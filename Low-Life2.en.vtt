I don't like eggs. They smell.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.695
Uh… Would you like an egg, sir?

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.573
No, thanks. You can have it.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:25.784
Uh… Hey, you want one?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.331

Okay.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.428

come to a complete stop…

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.907
Here you go.
Come on, let's go.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.996
Damn, that was cramped.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.331
Ah… There's that salt.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.375
Smell that air.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.628
It's really boiling
down here. Guess that's the south for you.

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:21.089
What's the plan?
We're going straight to the inn?

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.382
Yeah? Is that okay?

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.886
Yeah. Perfect. Mm-hmm.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.178
Hey, Jeonchul.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.056
Keep posing like that,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.684

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.061

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.774
Okay.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.860
Obviously we're gonna draw attention here.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:45.196
So listen.
Let's just grab the stuff and bail.

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.407
Sir.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.618
Now that's what I like to hear.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:51.453
Let's go.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.248
Here's the address.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:06:59.836

is tucked away like this?

- Welcome in.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.561
I reckon he's over there.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:17.812
Thank you.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.695
Excuse me.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.782

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.158

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.119

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.043 line:20%
Mr. Song should've told you
we were on our way. I'm Oh Gwanseok.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.003
Would you look at that.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:45.131
Y'all city folk look real badass,
don't you?

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.716
How much schooling did you get?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.842
Huh?

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.302
School.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.640
Well, actually I dropped out.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.101
I could tell, looking at your face.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.603
You can read someone like that
just by looking at their face?

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.105
Fuck if I can.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.608
I'm getting some really bad vibes.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.402
What sign are you?

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.612
-Huh?
-Your zodiac sign.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.407
Year of the Pig, '35.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.409

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.953
the Month of the Tiger,
the Hour of the Tiger.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.455
Even though the day was off,

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.457
I'm definitely a tiger.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.585
Taking orders is the one thing
I couldn't do.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.756
You see, not once have I ever
let anyone boss me around.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.134
Don't believe it?

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:40.353
- This body, it's got a lot of history.
- Oh.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.688
Jeonchul,

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.108
- weren't you hot?
- What?

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.152
You should probably cool off.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.447
Right.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.417
-Where's the tap?
-Uh…

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.630
Start unpacking.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.632
-Where's the bathroom?
-O-Over there.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.260
Uh… It's over this way, I think.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:14.929
So how was the pottery first discovered?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:17.557
Well,
when fisherman would go out to fish,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.769
now and then, they'd get a piece
stuck in their nets,

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.896
- give 'em the heebie-jeebies.
- Huh?

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.065
'Cause back in the day,
when you die at sea…

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.026
They'd send you off
with pottery?

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.862
Well, you still gotta eat
in the afterlife, don't you?

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.406
So they're buried at sea with everything,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.867
- spoons, chopsticks, you name it.
- Huh?

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.745
I can't believe this.
Just my luck.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.123
This one guy was just using it
as a dog bowl,

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.876
when one day, his brother,
a grade school teacher,

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.629
came over
and thought it looked it was valuable.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.715
-So he reported it to the county office.
-County? Why?

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.884
'Cause it looked important,
hence the county.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:57.055
He must have figured it was valuable
and went after the reward. See?

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.307
- Mmm.
- Yeah. But what fucking reward?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.226
They gave him jack shit.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:05.063
Then the Cultural Heritage Administration
showed up to look at the bowl.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:09.275
They could tell it was Chinese
and decided it was from the Yuan Dynasty.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:12.612
Now, what's the biggest mystery?

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.531
Huh? Huh?

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.617
What is all this Chinese pottery
doing here?

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.245
Exactly.
Give me those cigarettes.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.959
You see, back then,
China used to do trade.

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.502
In Japan,

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:28.628
JAPAN

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.712
Goryeo,

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.797
GORYEO

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.881
and India.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.550
INDIA - CHINA

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.177
But there was no way
to sail straight from China to Japan.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.221
Why? I mean, what did they have?

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.515
Not motors. They relied on wind.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.767
But the wind don't blow your way.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:47.564
That's why the Chinese, they stopped
at Sinan on their way to Japan.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:48.648
SINAN

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:52.402 line:20%
So then,
this was their stopover, right?

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.112
- That's right.
- Mmm.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.657
And then one day,
the wind blew crazy strong.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.411
And Sinan is known to be surrounded
by islands, right?

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.955
The currents are rough,
and the waves are high.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.249
The wind was going this way and that way.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.668
And then the boat they were on
smashed into pieces.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.129
-Mm-hmm.
-Have you seen it, old man?

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.674
You don't have to see everything
to get the idea.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.801
Do you have to look
before you wipe your ass?

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.761
You don't
'cause you already know it's there.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.055
This is bullshit.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.767
We're here to find the pottery,
not sit through a fucking history lesson.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.020
Digging at the location of the pottery

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.397
could send you to an early grave,
you fool.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.191
What did you just say?

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.318
You trying to put a curse on us
or something, you shit?

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.236
What's wrong with you?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.322
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.032
I was just saying.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.116
Hi, sir.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.203
Yeah. Everything's fine.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.370
HAESEONG STORE

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.415
It's like I'm in school.
I have no idea what they're talking about.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.376
Yeah, uh, all right. Okay.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.544
Take care.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:57.675
- All right.
- Thank you.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:58.927
Oh, yeah.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.681
You can go ahead.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.934
I'll be a while, I'm calling home.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.020
Then do you mind giving me space?

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.482
I'll use the one at the inn.

00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:26.537
Damn.
He was one good-looking fella.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.374
-Who was?
-The young one I mean.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:33.920
He's got fair skin
and a nice looking face too.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.048
Yeah, but he's pretty ignorant
about the world.

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:41.135
Well, I was a real
Casanova too, you know, back in the day.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.347
Oh, wow. What's this
"back in the day" all of a sudden?

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:54.899
Cheon residence.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.359
Hi.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.320
- It's for you. It's Jeonchul.
- Hmm.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.658
Jeonchul, have you started?

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:05.743
No, sir. Not yet.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.120
What's the hold-up?

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:10.206
We just got here, unpacked and
talked to some locals about the pottery.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.500
They're not acting
suspicious, are they?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.795
-They're not.
-Then the guy who's in charge,

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.631
looks like he knows
how to handle business.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.800
You should try and get in with him.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.094
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:26.681
Hey, hey. Go ahead
and get some athlete's foot cream, okay?

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:29.350
Sir?

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.978
No, no,
I wasn't talking to you.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.229
Keep an eye on them.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.064
See if they pull any bullshit.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:36.858
Right.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.609
They're money-grubbers, aren't they?

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:43.823
See, the clever ones, they always
got a trick up their sleeves, a big hand.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.075
You understand?

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.494
And bitches and assholes,
they're all the same.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.414
I'll keep that in mind.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.374
Well, don't get too hung up on it.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.835
Just need you to get me results.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.756
Yes, I understand.
I'll call you later, sir.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.761
Here you go. Keep the change.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:09.849
You done with your call?

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:12.435
Thought I asked for some space.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:14.937
I wasn't listening in, okay?

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.483
Look, you little bitch.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:21.402
If I say give me some space,
that means fuck off.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.156
Hey, I'm trying to be nice here,
you piece of shit.

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:26.657
So lose the fucking attitude.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.452
Wow, I'm about to lose my mind here.

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.747
A dumbass like you doesn't
exactly have a mind to lose,

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.831
you stupid fuck.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.375
If you keep pushing me,
then I'll cut you to pieces

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:37.752
and feed you to the fucking fish.

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.837
Oh, you're gonna feed the fish?
Where you doing that?

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.673
Do you know how many fish farms we have
in this country?

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:45.093
-You ever had oysters?
-You think oysters are fish?

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.552
Now I know you're a fucking idiot.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.096
Wait, what?

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:49.639
Hey, good to see you.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.724
Uh…

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:52.975
Thought you were in Seoul.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.520
We-we just got here.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.688
You should've come by
when you got in.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.565
I want to hear about Seoul.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.567
What? Was the café around here?

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.320
No, it weren't.
The café is over yonder there.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.948
-What the hell?
-Heedong.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.158
You didn't introduce us?

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:10.868
Oh, uh…

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.495
Your name is Heedong, huh?

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.498
Dang, if that ain't a Seoul name…

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.626
Remember your promise.
Don't forget it now, you hear?

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.462
I'll be off now.

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.050
Ah, shit.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.886
You were already here?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.971
Who is that?

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.222
Just a girl I met earlier.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.057
So you have been here before?

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.142
For what?

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.147
Hey. You boys trying something here?

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.524
And watch who you call "boy," you asshole!

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.527
Keeps on running his damn mouth.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.320
Really pissing me off.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.406 line:20%
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.951
Guess who's back.

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.703
Took ya long enough.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.497
Oh, and just when I thought I was finished
with the dishes, you bring more.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.791
- I can finish here.
- No, it's fine.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:02.211
Just go clean up the washroom a little
before the boss bitches again.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.338
- So hey.
- Hmm?

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.382
You know,
that guy from Seoul is back here.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.718
Who? The third cousin?

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.512
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, what's he doing back here?

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.097
Think I caught his eye?

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.017
You're laughing.
I'm getting my feelings hurt here.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.227
No, that ain't it though.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.314
He was talking with another guy.
They were gonna throw down too.

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:23.149
What's he gonna throw down for?

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.235
He didn't look like
he was a sailor or nothing.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.196
It's probably about the pottery.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.198
What? Pottery?

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.617
You don't really need to know.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.871
That little string bean never misses
a chance to mess with me.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.873
Does she now?

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:42.001
I still think he's here for me.

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:43.461
You caught nothing out there?

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.296
- Yeah.
- Ah, shoot.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.548
You still gotta eat dinner, don't you?

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:50.885
- I'm just gonna get some soju.
- I'll join you.

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.679
-You know the bar by the underpass?
-Uh-huh. I know it.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.140
-I'll see you soon.
-Yeah, yeah. I'll see you there then.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.391
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.396
He got back from fishing just now.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.690
He's pissed off
he didn't catch a single thing.

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.817
What's the captain's boat like?

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.445
Well, the boat's a ten-tonner.

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.447
But it's not his boat.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.366
His pop's the captain of it.

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:16.035
But if you'd call Taesan "Captain,"
he'd like it.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.453
Let's go.

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.041
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.668
Well, let's take everyone then.

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:24.835
They've got to eat too.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:28.005
Yeah, yeah. Have it your way.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.840
- Guys, let's go eat.
- Oh, okay.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.551
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.849
Dang, there's a whopper right here.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.019
Ah, you're already here.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:43.688
- Hello. Come on in.
- Hi, hi.

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.648
Hey. Come over here.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.568
I'll introduce ya.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.403
This is Captain Hwang.

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.487 line:20%
CAPTAIN HWANG

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.905 line:20%
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.950
This here, Oh Gwanseok from Seoul.

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.452
This is the guy my good friend sent down.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.747
These guys,
they're his juniors.

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:02.873
Come on. Say hi.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:04.542
- Uh… Hello.
- Hi.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.336
You didn't reel in much, I heard.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.589
We haul up. "Reel in" is angler talk, see.

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:10.673
Mmm…

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:15.219
Uh… Nowadays,
you get a lot of croakers, right?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.597
Right now,
it's all pomfrets, not croakers.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.766
Hey, missus. Grill up some pomfrets.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.685
Don't chuck the heads, just crisp them up.

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.021
-I eat them whole.
-Sure thing.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.897
-Yeah.
-You guys can…

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.150
Uh… You can sit right over there.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.484
Oh… Yeah.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.570
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. See you later.

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.238
All right, let's sit down.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.578
Who was that girl from earlier?

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.163
The truth is

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.832
I'm seeing this other girl in town
and that's why I've been here before.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:47.251
What? You got a chick
all the way down here?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:50.671
Yeah, when we broke up,
I couldn't get over her, you know?

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.424
Came down to see her,
but she had already moved on.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:54.967
That's when I met the café girl.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.095
Wow, you really are a piece of shit.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.389
Did you start chasing
another girl already?

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.976
Look, you gotta seriously reflect on this.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.686
Sit in that misery.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.064
Trying to find out where you fucked up
and how, huh?

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.358
All that shit, you fucking manwhore.

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:11.859
You fucking…

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.322
Here. You ain't drinking today?

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.240
Nah, not right now.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.408
Hmm…

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:23.496
- You trying to find pottery?
- Yeah.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.874
Check it, Jeungdo and Dodeokdo is here.

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:29.126
There's a tidal creek in the middle.

00:19:29.752 --> 00:19:33.714
And the water flows between
Jido, Imjado, and Sudo here like this.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.508
It's deep, 20 meters or so.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.301
That is deep.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:40.221
- Wow. Twenty meters.
- Yep.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:44.350
And with a deep creek comes
crazy currents, muddy as hell.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.354
And when it becomes all muddy like that,
visibility is shit.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.232
-Digging there is gonna be a bitch.
-Fridays are for drinking.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:52.817
Get your ass in there.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.443
Whoa, Taesan.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.570
Hey. Did you just get back from fishing?

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.739
- Yeah, yeah.
- You got company here?

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.784
- These here are Seoul folk, you know.
- Ah…

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.245
Oh. What's this?
Look what the cat dragged in.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.416
What is a city slicker
doing all the way out here?

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:12.378
Who knows what big city men
get up to? Have a seat and drink.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:15.589
It's cool.
Y'all just keep having your discussion.

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:17.717
I'm gonna drink over here with these boys.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:21.887
Sit.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.514
Wow, we meet again.

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:26.517
I hope you don't mind if we sit here.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.478
And if you do, you can let me know.
No problem.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.981
- Here you are. Enjoy, all right?
- Thanks.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.733
Dang, it's a pomfret.

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:36.444
Hey, Boss. Do you knock back a few drinks
with these guys?

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:38.237
Of course we should.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.321
-Go get it.
-On it, Boss.

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:41.157
-And get a cold one.
-Yeah.

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.577
Seems like you haven't had pomfret before.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.704
Do you even know how to eat it?

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.539
Uh… Where are the glasses, you idiot?

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:49.999
Glasses. Right.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.502
Hey, get us a bottle
and some glasses too.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:54.587
Yes, sir.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.465
-You plan on drinking?
-How do you talk without a drink?

00:20:58.215 --> 00:20:59.759
I don't drink when I'm working.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.595
- Here you go.
- Mmm.

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:04.722
Mmm.

00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:08.809
Anyway, what I'm saying is I think
you're wasting your fucking time here.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.061
Even if you take a boat
out there and dive in,

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.980
you can't do it in a night.

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:16.734
So what?

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:21.906
Well, at first, you were paying me enough
to take you out there

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.908
and get some fresh air while I was at it.

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:27.286
That place, though, is a damn mess.
We can't do it.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:31.040
What is this? I already made a deal
with your pop though.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.458
You can't back out now.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:33.584
Whatever.

00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:36.378
I'm the one driving the boat
while he's laying there in bed.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:38.923
What's the point in saying anything
to that sick old man?

00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:40.132
Oh, shit!

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:42.384
Stop picking at it.

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:43.928
Enough of this.

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.180
Take your spoon and get a real bite,
why don't ya?

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:49.892
I'm really starting to lose my appetite
just watching you.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.185
What are you, a kid?

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:58.442
What? What the fuck are you staring at?

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.737
Lose the glare, you little shit.

00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.668
Y'all have had pomfret, have you not?

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:19.213
Have you tried it before?
Ah… It's so nice and savory.

00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:20.548
See? I'm telling you.

00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:22.883
It doesn't get any better
than this right here.

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.350
Hey, you do know how to eat it.

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.394
You're gonna choke. Slow down.

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:35.938
At least get the bones out
before you take a bite.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.857
Nobody told you to eat like a sailor.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.361
Got something you wanna share
with the rest of the class?

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:44.905
- Ah, fuck.
- Whoa, man.

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:46.115
That's a switchblade, yo!

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.701
Hot damn, Boss.
That's expensive as shit.

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.995
Hey, Beolgu. Check this out.
You push this right here,

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.288
and the knife flips out.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.164
- Oh, really?
- Check it.

00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:55.916
Whoa, look at that.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.501
I've always wanted one of these.

00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:59.044
Watch this.

00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:00.379
You do this and then…

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:01.630
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.048
The blade just shoots right out.

00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:04.466
That's awesome, huh.

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:06.552
Hey, city folks.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.722
Care to step outside?

00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:13.517
What are you doing?

00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.686
If you've got guests from out of town,

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:18.772
you're supposed to give them
a warm welcome, aren't you?

00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:25.404
-Is this the Mokpo greeting?
-I think he's getting angry.

00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:28.407
Dang, he's so pale.

00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:34.622
If you wanna see the Chungcheong fist,
then go right ahead.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.585
You've got one hell of a crazy look
in your eyes, you clown.

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:42.129
-We going out?
-Sure.

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.589
Eh?

00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.049
Let's do this then.

00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:46.675
- Dang.
- Come on. Let's go outside.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.345
- You, outside.
- Come on guys, let's do it.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.146
Make it quick.

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:05.861
Wow.

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.738
Dang, look at his footwork.

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.116
Let's go.

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:15.120
-You the boss here?
-Yeah, that's right, guy.

00:24:15.204 --> 00:24:17.581
Yeah? Well, I'm a boxer, you fu--

00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.627
-No way.
-Check out how awkward his stance is.

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.587
Where'd you learn to box?

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.215
Fucking asshole. Lose the knife.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.508
What did you just say?

00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:29.927
I said lose the knife, you fucking pussy.

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.513
-You son of a…
-You're losing your shit--

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:33.931
Quit it!

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:43.857
Quit what?

00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:45.693
Quit what, huh?

00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:49.113
Hey, what did we do exactly?

00:24:49.196 --> 00:24:50.406
Nothing yet.

00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:56.453
You're gonna need a few divers for this.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.582
Don't worry about that, I'll handle it.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.336
-What is it that you want?
-How 'bout half.

00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:06.088
Half of what?

00:25:07.006 --> 00:25:08.632
What do you think, man?
Half the pot.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.137
You fucking kidding me right now?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.849
Even if we dig up every last one, that
don't mean we can just cash in like that.

00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:19.184
Gotta find a buyer with a lot of dough.

00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:22.646
And you gotta be able to close the deal.
You're not the only one working here.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.356
Look. What I'm saying is

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.151
without us,
this job completely falls apart.

00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:30.112
One of us ain't any more important
than the others.

00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:34.533
If you believe all it takes is rolling up
your pants, then well,

00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:37.244
- knock yourselves out.
- Son of a…

00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:43.584
Besides, only a handful of people
were there.

00:25:44.168 --> 00:25:46.170
Not even the navy knew how to find it.

00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:49.548
Had to go over to the prison to grab one
of the divers there to figure it out.

00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:53.052 line:20%
Not just anyone can find this shit.

00:25:53.135 --> 00:25:54.261 line:20%
MEASURING WITH EYES

00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:56.847 line:20%
So you're saying
our chance at failure is high?

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.098
That's right.

00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.517
We could sell it ourselves
if we wanted to.

00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:03.145
If we had the money,
we would dig it up ourselves too.

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.271
Wouldn't even need you.

00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:10.903
Fine. All right.

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:12.321
We hear what you're saying.

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:15.532
Since you're so confident
you know how to sell what we'll find,

00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:18.577
I'll give you 30% of all of it.

00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:20.454
Thirty percent?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.083
-Think I can't do it?
-The expenses for the job,

00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:25.876
we'll handle all of it.

00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:28.962
So if we haul in 100, I'm giving you 30.

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:30.672
Go sell them yourself.

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.805
I'm sure that there are big shots
down here in Mokpo for sure.

00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:39.473
The only thing is that it's pottery.

00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:42.392
So no matter the value,
people don't just throw money at it.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.813
Except in Seoul. Seoul is the only place.

00:26:45.896 --> 00:26:48.065
Seoul is the only place you can sell it.

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:51.235
And do you know how many it takes
to sell pottery there?

00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:56.907
We need a captain, several workers,
a manager to oversee them.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.202
We'll need divers to swim under.
And when they find the pottery,

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:04.123
we'll need an expert for the appraisal
a delivery guy and a broker to store it,

00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:06.250
and a go-between for the buyer.

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:07.918
And who even knows who wants it.

00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:11.255
They could be a trader
or some sort of politician.

00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:14.133
Soon enough,
the middlemen will just keep increasing.

00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:15.926
Then even if you get the highest price,

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:18.178
who knows how much
you're taking home though, huh?

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:22.766
After all that work,
you might score big, or get jack shit.

00:27:23.267 --> 00:27:26.103
I'm glad you can actually sell it.
Go for it if you want.

00:27:26.937 --> 00:27:28.897
But I wonder how much
you'll walk away with.

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:33.944
Beolgu. What are you doin' here?

00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:35.529
- Sir!
- Oh, sir.

00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:37.406
- Oh, sir. Good to see ya.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.575
Listen.

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:41.410
Park is gonna butcher a cow.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.037
-Wanna head over there with us right now?
-Oh, the guy from Seongmigol?

00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:45.122
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:47.207
Wow, I bet
he's having a party or somethin'.

00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:48.876
- That's right, son.
- Right.

00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:51.169
You guys go ahead. I'll catch up after.

00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:54.464
What's the matter with him?
Why's he shirtless?

00:27:54.548 --> 00:27:57.634
Oh, uh, yeah.
Uh, this fella always runs hot, you know?

00:27:57.718 --> 00:28:00.345
I can spot bullshit from a mile away.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.557
Hey, uh, you kids
aren't doin' nothing wrong, are ya?

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.183
Nah, it's not like that.

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:07.311
Don't worry about it and go enjoy.

00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:09.438
- All right then. I'll see you later.
- Sure.

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.398
I'd love to come.
Do you think I could tag along?

00:28:11.481 --> 00:28:13.525
Ugh, don't you have things to do?

00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:14.902
Right. Good day, sir.

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.654
Chief constable there.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.032
Him and I go back aways.

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:22.117
Good to have a guy like that
in your corner.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.121
You animals
are really territorial, huh?

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.956
This fucking guy.

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:31.793
Oh, yeah?

00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:37.966
Hey, go over there
and grab me a piece of wood.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.051
Yes, sir.

00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:42.638
How much we talkin'?

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.057
Million.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:48.101
The most I could squeeze
out of the money man.

00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:50.437
-A million.
-Yeah?

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.106
And if we're counting expenses
then double that. Two mil.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.156
Think on it for a bit.

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:03.367
You know that's not pocket change.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.205
What's there to think about?
This is straight-up bullshit, man.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.463
If you get rid of the bastards
who are starting shit with my guys,

00:29:17.214 --> 00:29:20.175
it's big money…
that two million.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:27.474
- Right here, bitch.
- All right, city slicker.

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:28.892
-Let's go.
-Can tell by your breath, asshole.

00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:30.102
Ready to get your ass beat, son of a--

00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:32.604
What you gonna do, huh?

00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:33.689
What are you doin'?

00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:36.358
Hey, Honggi.

00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:41.989 line:20%
What's goin' on here?

00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:44.324 line:20%
SIM HONGGI

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.494
Let's see it.

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:51.999
I pledge,
in front of the proud Taegeuk flag,

00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:55.335
-allegiance to the Republic of Korea…
-What the hell were you doin'?

00:29:55.419 --> 00:29:58.296
-…for the eternal glory of the country.
-What's it to you? Handlin' business.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.424
- Liberty and freedom…
- What'd you say?

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:02.801
- …to the Republic of Korea.
- Handling business?

00:30:06.013 --> 00:30:08.557
-Where are y'all from?
-Seoul.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.351
You know this guy?

00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:12.436
Not a bit.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.111
So what the hell's goin' on here?

00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:24.573
- Doin' a shakedown?
- No, I told you.

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.867
Why are you on my ass so hard today, huh?

00:30:27.868 --> 00:30:30.954
Watch who you're fuckin' talkin' to,
you stupid son of a bitch.

00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:33.081
Forget I got a badge?

00:30:34.124 --> 00:30:36.543
All right, I hear you.

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:38.295
I'll just send them on their way
and that's that.

00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:39.546
No, I think not.

00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:42.049
I think you are the one's who gotta leave.

00:30:42.716 --> 00:30:45.260
This motherfucker's
workin' my last nerve.

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:46.762
Yeah?

00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:49.639
You're talkin' pretty big.

00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:53.185
What do ya think?
Should I just haul all your asses in?

00:30:57.397 --> 00:30:59.316
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:02.235
We're going.

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:04.654
You should stop goin' around
causin' trouble.

00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:07.115
Just take better care of my aunt, okay?

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:08.575
Son of a bitch.

00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:11.036
Stay in your fucking lane, piece of shit.

00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:12.621
You think you're making Uncle so proud,

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.539
- is that it? Shit.
- Come on, walk away, Boss.

00:31:14.623 --> 00:31:16.124
What you fucking doing, huh?

00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:18.001
Don't butt in when adults are talkin'…

00:31:18.085 --> 00:31:21.129
-Hey, come on. Give it a rest, Beolgu.
-…you stupid little piece of shit. Fuck!

00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:25.509
These bush-league gangsters
are acting like damn middle schoolers.

00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:27.219
Stupid fuckin' idiots.

00:31:28.595 --> 00:31:29.805
So anyway,

00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:32.349
what are you doin' here from Seoul?

00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:34.351
Well…

00:31:35.185 --> 00:31:36.436
Hey, Honggi.

00:31:37.813 --> 00:31:38.814
What's goin' on?

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.941
What's this?

00:31:42.484 --> 00:31:43.819
Are these guys here with you?

00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:47.197
Did somethin' happen?

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.658
What are you doin'
with people from Seoul, huh?

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.868
Now what makes you care so much
about my business

00:31:51.952 --> 00:31:53.954
that you gotta interrogate me like this?

00:31:54.037 --> 00:31:57.499
They don't look like
they're regular guys, that's all.

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:00.043
Okay, I've heard enough outta you.
Let's git.

00:32:02.212 --> 00:32:03.797
All right, I'll be in touch.

00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:09.469
What the hell
have you gotten yourself into now?

00:32:10.512 --> 00:32:11.513
It's nothin'.

00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:13.932
A whole mess of outsiders swarming in
and causing a scene.

00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:15.809
-Put your shirt on, idiot.
-That seem like nothing to you?

00:32:15.892 --> 00:32:18.562
-The entire neighborhood is staring.
-You're the one causing the scene.

00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:21.982
Hey, why the hell are you guys
always taking your shirts off?

00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:23.483
Little shits.

00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:25.068
Ah, shoot.

00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:27.362
He turned out to be an asshat, didn't he?

00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:29.239
I had him pegged all wrong.

00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:30.907
Greedy sumbitch, huh?

00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:33.243
You had him pegged all wrong, that right?

00:32:33.326 --> 00:32:35.328
I'll be… What's that tone?

00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:38.540
If I knew he was like that
I wouldn't have brought him in.

00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:40.417
Oh, yeah?

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:43.295
A guy who has spent
his whole life catching fish

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:45.297
and now he thinks he can sell pottery?

00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:49.301
He didn't come up with that himself.
Someone put it in his head.

00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:51.970
You implyin' I did that?

00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:53.346
Implying? No.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.265
Let me be direct.

00:32:57.392 --> 00:33:01.605
Don't even think about contacting
Mr. Song again. You got that?

00:33:11.573 --> 00:33:13.325
Y-Yeongsu really tried doing that?

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:15.577
Hey, that's just…

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:19.039
You can't trust
anyone these days.

00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:22.542
From now on, I'm the only one you talk to.

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:24.586
This place is full of crooks.

00:33:25.462 --> 00:33:27.005
Okay, so what's your deal
with the captain?

00:33:28.423 --> 00:33:29.633
2.5 million.

00:33:29.716 --> 00:33:31.176
2.5 million?

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:32.302
That's way too much.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:34.930
It's not just the captain either.
This is gonna cost a lot.

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:37.390
We also have to find the guy
who knows where it all is.

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:41.478
We're gonna need another five mil.
On top of all the other costs.

00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:44.272
- Five million?
- Mr. Song.

00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:45.857
We don't really have a choice.

00:33:46.775 --> 00:33:47.984
The water's pretty rough here,

00:33:48.068 --> 00:33:49.903
and if these guys start acting up,
we're screwed.

00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.698
Ugh, this is a real pain.

00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:57.285
So all that aside, what am I getting here?

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.497
-What are you getting?
-Wait a minute.

00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:03.416
You're not telling me to make do
with what's left over?

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.461
Hey, listen. The two of us
can work out the details later.

00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.339
Look, I'm planting seeds
with Cheon right now, okay?

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:11.967
We're all gonna end this job a lot richer.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.552
There's nothing I hate more
than beating around the bush.

00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:16.137
I get it, I get it.

00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:19.891
Anyway, look, Gwanseok,
I'm counting on you, hmm?

00:34:19.975 --> 00:34:23.561
By the way, at the train station,
was Chairman Cheon serious about that?

00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:25.230
What do you mean?

00:34:28.942 --> 00:34:31.361
Im Jeonchul. Cheon wants him dead.

00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:57.220
Hey, Seongcheol!

00:34:57.304 --> 00:34:58.305
Hey.

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:02.601
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:06.187
- I wasn't expecting you.
- Hey.

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:09.274
You don't think you can
cook up more ceramics, huh?

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:12.068
-Well, which ones?
-The farming ones.

00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:13.612
And how many are we talkin' here?

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:15.488
Look, can you do it or not?

00:35:15.572 --> 00:35:17.449
This is all getting out of hand.

00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:19.034
Hey, what's going on?

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.244
The cost keeps growing and growing and I…

00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:27.042
I already gave Gwanseok a million won,
and now he's back, wanting another five.

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.835
Oh, wow.

00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:31.212
Mighty big problem this is.

00:35:31.838 --> 00:35:33.173
- Hey.
- Huh?

00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:36.760
What if Chairman Cheon decides
to back out? What are you gonna do then?

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.387
Well, that's not going to happen.

00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:42.307
But I guess, just in case,
I should think of something.

00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:44.309
- Right.
- Mmm.

00:35:45.018 --> 00:35:47.604
Having a backup couldn't hurt.

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.314
- The rest are in the storage.
- Oh.

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:51.066
Let me just finish up here first.

00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:53.443
Sure, go on. Yeah.

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:00.700
Son of a bitch.

00:36:00.784 --> 00:36:02.786
- Asshole. Wanna go?
- Get your hands off me. Okay, let's go.

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.287
- You ready?
- Let's do this, jackass.

00:36:04.371 --> 00:36:05.830
Why do you have a knife, huh?

00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:07.207
'Cause I just do. What?

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.500
And why would you reach for it?

00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:11.044
Fuck was I supposed to do?
Sit there and take their shit?

00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:13.755
You fucking idiot. You think
I kept quiet because I wanted to?

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:15.548
You dumb ass almost fucked everything up.

00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:17.759
What's going on? What is it?

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:20.804
He went for his knife and got caught
because he's a dumb son of a bitch.

00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:22.847
-Stop it.
-Even after they slapped me.

00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:24.474
I said cut it out!

00:36:24.557 --> 00:36:26.393
- Shit.
- Dumbasses.

00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:28.144
-Take a shot.
-Go for it.

00:36:28.228 --> 00:36:29.521
- Punch me.
- Punch me.

00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:30.689
-Punch me.
-Punch me, bitch.

00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:32.899
You can't do it, can you?

00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:35.360
-Come on, you fuck. Hit me.
-I dare you, lil pissant son of a bitch.

00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.070
-You're asking for it.
-Take your shot.

00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:39.322
The hell was that?
What's your problem?

00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:41.241
What? What the hell
is your fucking problem?

00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:42.575
You little brat.

00:36:44.327 --> 00:36:46.538
Oh Heedong, listen.

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:48.289
No more of this shit.

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:50.667
You don't make enemies
before you set sail.

00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:53.920
Do that and who do you think
will become fish food first?

00:36:54.003 --> 00:36:56.965
You know what the most important thing
is when you go out to sea?

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:59.634
It's trust, you fucking idiot.

00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:01.261
Trust that they won't kill you.

00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:03.555
You get tossed overboard
and you're finished, do you hear me?

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:07.016
So stop stirring up shit.

00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:10.228
I've got a lot on my plate as it is.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.445
Fuck this!

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.287
You're looking as beautiful as always,
Mrs. Yang.

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:29.539
Listen, Mrs. Yang.

00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:31.708
About that favor I asked…

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:33.293
What was it again?

00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:36.254
Well,
regarding my brother-in-law.

00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:38.798
-Ah, for work.
-Yes.

00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:41.301
Well, you see,
my husband and I have been busy.

00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:42.886
I haven't brought it up yet.

00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:43.970
MARILYN BOUTIQUE

00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:47.474
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

00:37:47.557 --> 00:37:51.019
I forgot. These are a Gimcheon delicacy,
Joma potatoes.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.520
Right, set it there.

00:37:53.438 --> 00:37:54.439
Okay.

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:56.608
Ah, and, ma'am?

00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:01.571
This month's.

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:04.699
You know, I really do appreciate
you always being on time.

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:06.868
Oh, of course, it's the least I can do.

00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:10.830
Well, Mrs. Yang,
I really hope you can help me out.

00:38:11.915 --> 00:38:14.250
-Okay, I'll see you.
-Oh, ma'am.

00:38:14.334 --> 00:38:17.045
Right,
just hand that to my driver.

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.421
Yes, ma'am.

00:38:19.172 --> 00:38:20.507
Jin, I'm here.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:23.176
- What are you doing in there?
- Hey! One minute.

00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:25.303
- Then I'm gonna make a call.
- Okay!

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:29.307
All right.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.852
Absolutely stunning.

00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:36.856
- Let's go with this one.
- All right then. I'll take it.

00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:39.025
Hi, dear.

00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:40.401
Hi, where are you?

00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:42.737
Oh, I'm at the hair salon right now.

00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:45.740
Um,
have you heard anything yet?

00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:47.575
No, I haven't heard anything.

00:38:48.076 --> 00:38:50.078
Jeonchul always calls you though,
doesn't he?

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.706
All right, look, quit shopping
and go home then.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:54.874
Hurry and finish up.

00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:57.836
Okay, I'll head home soon.

00:38:57.919 --> 00:38:59.420
- When exactly?
- Bye, take care.

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:01.047
Now. I'm heading home now.

00:39:01.673 --> 00:39:02.674
Bye.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.929
Ugh,
he just has to keep me locked up at home.

00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:10.682
Even the monkeys at Changgyeong
have more freedom.

00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:14.853
- Hey, did you collect all the payments?
- Mmm.

00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:17.313
I don't know
if it's worth sneaking around

00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:19.107
for this kind of chump change.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.442
You stack up that chump change
and you'll make it big.

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:23.903
How's that sailor husband
of yours doing?

00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:25.238
Mm-hmm, he's in Mokpo now.

00:39:25.321 --> 00:39:26.656
Mokpo, why?

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.201
Guess being a sailor
was always meant to be.

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:32.787
- Hmm?
- Wait a second. He hasn't called yet.

00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:36.332
- I have to make a call.
- Of course. Go for it.

00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.167
Welcome.

00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:43.423
Hello? How are you?

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.425
Doin' just fine.

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.176
Have you eaten?

00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:50.597
-Mmm.
-Wait, why do you sound so down?

00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.390
Are they treating you okay there?

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:54.976
Yeah, everything's fine.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.020
You should stay
on yourtoes.

00:39:57.103 --> 00:39:59.022
They're not ordinary guys,
that's for sure.

00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:00.523
I know.

00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:03.610
- Think I should come down there?
- Why would you come here?

00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:05.403
I don't know.

00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:07.780
I could buy you all some lunch.
Don't you think that would be nice?

00:40:07.864 --> 00:40:10.992
As if the chairman
would ever let you.

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.369
I guess you're right.

00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:15.496
So everything's really okay?

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.124
I already said yes.
Why are you getting on my case?

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:21.002
- What's with the attitude?
- Whatever. I gotta to go.

00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:25.465
- Ugh.
- Have a good day!

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:26.549
Bye!

00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:28.843
What was that?

00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:32.138
He's grumpier than ever now.

00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:34.182
That means he's happy, right?

00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:37.894
- Here. Mmm.
- Yes!

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.563
Can we get some food already?

00:40:40.647 --> 00:40:41.856
Yeah, coming.

00:40:42.357 --> 00:40:45.652
All right,
let's have a drink and let it go.

00:40:45.735 --> 00:40:47.487
Here. Mmm.

00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:55.578
-Daesik, why aren't you drinking?
-Oh, uh, I can't drink booze.

00:40:57.372 --> 00:40:59.165
All right, guys. Tell him you're sorry.

00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.625
For what?

00:41:01.376 --> 00:41:04.253
You don't fight in front of your elders.
Quickly now.

00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:06.923
My apologies.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.634
For what? Guys are just like that.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:14.055
Sometimes you throw insults,
and sometimes you throw punches, right?

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:18.393
I used to get into a lot of fights…
so I get it.

00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:21.354
- Oh, it's here.
- Here you go. Enjoy.

00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:23.272
- Thanks.
- Hey, can we get a refill

00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:24.691
-on these sides?
-Bum a cigarette?

00:41:24.774 --> 00:41:26.693
- Daesik, dig in.
- Oh, thanks.

00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:30.446
And c-can you clear
these empty bottles, please?

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.074
Can't you wait to smoke
after you eat?

00:42:01.728 --> 00:42:03.104
You wanna know how I got this scar?

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.939
Sure, man.

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:08.943
We were out in the water.

00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:11.571
The foreign crew staged
a rebellion out there.

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:14.699
It was a mutiny, I guess you could say.

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:18.036
I really should've been more careful
in my younger days.

00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:21.831
Instead, I got into a fight
with the captain, got shot.

00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:28.254
Then the boat hit the reef
and took on water,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.883
while my ass fell in the water
and got knocked out.

00:42:33.301 --> 00:42:36.512
Luckily, I had a life jacket on,
the only reason I'm here.

00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:40.725
I woke up on the shore,
barely clinging to life.

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:42.685
I damn near died that day.

00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:48.149
What's your point?

00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:52.820
You son of a bitch.

00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:56.074
I've already faced death
once before out there.

00:42:57.617 --> 00:43:00.953
The thought of it,
heading out again to sea, I…

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.749
I'm scared. It's embarrassing.

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.752
But I'm scared shitless.

00:43:12.715 --> 00:43:13.716
Heedong.

00:43:16.844 --> 00:43:19.680
Listen. Let's not stab
each other in the back.

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:21.766
Okay?

00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:34.403
So, the ship…

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.949
How do we know exactly where it sank?

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:41.828
Well, there's a guy
who knows where it sank.

00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:43.121
He's a sailor.

00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:46.541
He's the one the navy relied on
during their search.

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:48.251
Well, where's the guy hiding?

00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:50.711
In prison.

00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:52.922
Prison?

00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:55.007
Without him, we're screwed.

00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:58.261
We should have Captain Hwang pay him
a visit. They're friends, after all.

00:43:58.344 --> 00:44:00.638
Wow.

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:05.393
- Close your mouth, will ya?
- Oh.

00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:13.151
Man,

00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:16.946
whole area from Yeongdeungpo to Jamsil

00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:19.448
is going to have major developments.

00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:22.618
So, the school…
Have you picked a location yet?

00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:26.998
The thing is, I don't know if
I should wait till the area's developed.

00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:29.792
You think the land prices will be patient?

00:44:29.876 --> 00:44:31.669
They'll probably skyrocket.

00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:36.090
How much will it cost?
The museum, that is.

00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:37.717
Hey.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.510
It won't be all that costly.

00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:42.680
It's all for show.

00:44:43.264 --> 00:44:46.726
Just enough to make me look good.

00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:48.477
I'm not going to go overboard.

00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:52.440
Right. If you have the funds,
Gangnam's right there.

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.692
Why would you invest anywhere else?

00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:56.986
I told you I have ideas.

00:44:57.069 --> 00:45:00.823
It looked to me like Song was set
on bleeding you dry and then some.

00:45:01.782 --> 00:45:04.035
You really told him
you'd buy everything they found?

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:05.953
Well, I'll knock off the price then.

00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:11.000
How about, instead,
you set a limit from the start?

00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:12.752
How's that work?

00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:14.503
What's the point of buying it all?

00:45:14.587 --> 00:45:17.715
If you set a limit for how many pieces
you'll take for the museum,

00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:20.468
they won't try any tricks. That simple.

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.470
What are you saying?

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:25.848
What if they throw in some fake ones then?

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:29.393
You really think
they would dare?

00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:31.646
I wouldn't bet on it.

00:45:33.356 --> 00:45:34.565
I'll meet with him then.

00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:37.735
We've already got so many expenses.

00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:40.321
Wouldn't being direct clear things up?

00:45:41.322 --> 00:45:42.490
Who are you meeting?

00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:45.910
Who else could it be? Mr. Song.

00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:01.509
Hey.

00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:03.844
Hold it tight.

00:46:05.638 --> 00:46:07.306
- Tighter.
- Just like this. Let go.

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:12.687
So that's all of them, yeah?

00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:14.647
Yeah.

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:16.857
That's another 200,

00:46:17.692 --> 00:46:19.485
so it's 500 in total.

00:46:19.986 --> 00:46:21.862
I'm gonna pass out.

00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:25.283
I should get
at least a hundred million for this.

00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:26.534
Still, though,

00:46:27.702 --> 00:46:31.706
if you had some real pieces from Sinan,
wouldn't you feel better about all this?

00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:34.208
Should I go to Mokpo myself then?

00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:36.502
Don't do that.

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:40.047
Think they'd be happy
with you breathing down their necks?

00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:42.758
Well, I want to see how it's going.
It's driving me crazy.

00:46:42.842 --> 00:46:45.720
You've got to leave it up to fate now.
Let's go.

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:48.556
- Captain.
- Yeah?

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.224
- Let's head back.
- Okay.

00:46:51.392 --> 00:46:52.893
Man, I'm exhausted.

00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:56.605 line:20%
MOKPO PRISON

00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:03.237
- He's here.
- Thanks, man.

00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:06.907
There he is.

00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:08.617
How you holdin' up, Bokgeun?

00:47:09.368 --> 00:47:10.369 line:20%
LEE BOKGEUN

00:47:10.453 --> 00:47:12.663 line:20%
-Why are you here?
-I'm here to see you, bud.

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:14.165
How you doin'?

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:17.251
Well, I'm pissed.
The yellow croaker thing was a bust.

00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:19.879
- It's bullshit.
- Fuck the yellow croakers.

00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:21.881
There's gold buried in the sea.

00:47:21.964 --> 00:47:23.716
Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:26.385
Why do you keep goin' on
about this treasure?

00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:27.845
I don't know anything.

00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:29.764
-Just go.
-Hey, just hear me out.

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:33.601
This fella here is from Seoul.

00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:37.855
- The fuck brings you here?
- We're here 'cause we need you.

00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:39.565
The spot, where exactly is it?

00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:41.525
You just explain,
and I can piece it together.

00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:43.361
You really think I'd tell you?

00:47:43.444 --> 00:47:45.196
So you can run off with the gold?

00:47:45.738 --> 00:47:48.240
You can't screw me over
just 'cause I'm in prison.

00:47:48.324 --> 00:47:50.368
I-I ain't screwin' you.
You'll get your cut.

00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:51.494
Fuck you, man.

00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:53.120
Fuck you and your bullshit.

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:55.623
Hey, look, how about this?

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.792
Tell me where the ship sank.

00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:00.127
I'll give you 200,000.

00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:02.254
As soon as we confirm it, you'll get it.

00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:03.672
Who is this?

00:48:03.756 --> 00:48:05.216
You the big boss or somethin'?

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:07.259
-Nah, that's not it.
-Yeah, that's right.

00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:10.137
Bullshit.

00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:12.640
You think you'll be
the boss out there too?

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.725
Out there, we're the boss.

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:17.103
What do you know about the ocean?
Jack shit.

00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:21.190
I can't explain it in words.

00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:23.025
I need to see it with my own eyes.

00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:24.402
- Only way it works.
- Come on.

00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:26.529
You're makin' no sense.

00:48:27.029 --> 00:48:28.823
How're you supposed to get
your eyes on it?

00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:31.242
Get me out.
Otherwise, you're screwed.

00:48:31.325 --> 00:48:34.120
If we had that kind of power,
why would we be here?

00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:36.247
We'd order the navy to drain the damn sea.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.541
Who else knows the location?

00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:39.667
You can't be the only one.

00:48:41.544 --> 00:48:42.545
You're right.

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:44.547
Seokbae also knows where it is.

00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:48.759
Oh, you're gonna have Seokbae
find the location for ya?

00:48:48.843 --> 00:48:52.096
Go ahead and knock yourselves out.
I wish you the best of luck.

00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:55.349
The navy dragged me out there
for a fuckin' reason.

00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:57.435
Well, he was still
one of the divers though.

00:48:57.518 --> 00:48:59.728
- He should know where it was.
- Yeah?

00:48:59.812 --> 00:49:00.980
So go ahead.

00:49:01.063 --> 00:49:04.191
I'm not telling you shit for 200,000 won.

00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:08.654
Or you go to your boss
and ask for more cash.

00:49:08.737 --> 00:49:10.906
Hey, I said I'm in charge,
you asshole.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.324
Don't make me say it again.

00:49:18.998 --> 00:49:20.666
Out there, we're the boss.

00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:23.085
What do you know about the ocean?
Jack shit.

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:47.234
When talking to someone in
prison, try to avoid answering right away.

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:51.197
Before speaking to the prisoner,
take a few deep breaths.

00:49:51.906 --> 00:49:53.449
- You're here.
- Hey.

00:49:54.617 --> 00:49:55.618
What's that?

00:49:56.911 --> 00:49:59.205
I want you to go
to Seosan-dong with Captain Hwang.

00:49:59.288 --> 00:50:01.332
There's a guy named Go Seokbae
somewhere around there.

00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:05.002
-And who's that?
-One of the divers who found the pottery.

00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:06.754
Ask him where the location is.

00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:08.881
Take Jeonchul with you.

00:50:08.964 --> 00:50:10.633
Nah, I'll take Daesik instead.

00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:12.593
Daesik and I are going shopping then.

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.428
Take Jeonchul.

00:50:17.473 --> 00:50:18.682
Oh, right.

00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:22.353
When you're angry,
ironing can help cool your head.

00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:24.480
WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY,
IERONING CAN HELP A LITTLE

00:50:40.538 --> 00:50:41.664
Fucking hell.

00:50:43.332 --> 00:50:44.750
He lives in the boonies.

00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:46.377
Whew!

00:50:49.088 --> 00:50:51.632
You seen this guy, Seokbae, 'round here?

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:52.716
Seokbae?

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.344
Let's see here.

00:50:55.427 --> 00:50:58.681
Seokbae… Is he Mr. Go's second oldest son?

00:50:59.265 --> 00:51:00.724
Yeah, that's right.

00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:02.768
Can you tell me where he lives then?

00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:04.645
I just see him around here sometimes.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.980
I don't know where he lives.

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:07.940
I get it. So where do you see him around?

00:51:08.023 --> 00:51:10.150
Where are you folks from?

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:12.361
We're here from Seoul, all right?

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:14.530
Just point us in the right direction.

00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:17.783
- Are you a detective?
- Hey, lady.

00:51:18.492 --> 00:51:20.536
Quietly.

00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:24.164
Right, I could tell
from just one look, I could.

00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:26.709
You guys came lookin'
a few months ago too.

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:27.835
What's the matter?

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.878
-You still haven't found him?
-What did I just say?

00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:31.922
Hey. Okay?

00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:37.052
-Tell us where he is.
-I don't know where exactly.

00:51:37.136 --> 00:51:39.888
Just go straight past this way,
and you'll see a stone wall.

00:51:39.972 --> 00:51:42.141
I think he lives somewhere around there.

00:51:42.224 --> 00:51:43.475
Thanks for that.

00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:45.227
All right, let's go.

00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:56.363
That guy's a real asshole,
acting so rude to someone he just met.

00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:01.243
- Ugh.
- Hey, kid.

00:52:02.578 --> 00:52:04.330
Do you know
if a guy named Seokbae lives here?

00:52:04.413 --> 00:52:05.998
Wait, what'd you say?

00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:09.209
Seokbae. Go Seokbae.
Apparently, he lives around here.

00:52:09.293 --> 00:52:11.128
I can't think right now.

00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:16.216
Sorry, but I'm too busy right now,
so I can't help you.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.719
What, are you busy playing?
'Cause that's all I see.

00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:21.263
Hey, Pop! Run for it!

00:52:21.347 --> 00:52:22.681
- Hurry up! Run! Run!
- Get him.

00:52:22.765 --> 00:52:24.141
- Oh, fuck!
- Seokbae!

00:52:25.392 --> 00:52:26.393
Wait, Seokbae!

00:52:26.894 --> 00:52:28.395
- Stop right there, punk!
- Move!

00:52:28.896 --> 00:52:30.522
I'm not a fucking cop!

00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:32.775
- Seokbae!
- I'm not a cop!

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:37.321
Son of a bitch!

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.413
Hey!

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:51.585
My whole body hurts.

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:54.505
Did you have to turn this
into such a hassle?

00:52:55.631 --> 00:52:56.840
I don't know anything.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.635
We're not here to get you.

00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:02.096

How the hell should I know that?

00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:18.153
I'd dig it up myself
if I knew where it was.

00:53:18.237 --> 00:53:20.406
You were the damn diver on the boat!

00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:21.615
How can you not remember?

00:53:22.658 --> 00:53:24.284
Ask the captain that took us there.

00:53:25.285 --> 00:53:27.621
I don't know shit about it.
I'm just a diver.

00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:29.415
Bokgeun could tell you where it's at.

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.959
Ugh, you're fucking kidding!

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.294
Bokgeun? And just who the fuck is that?

00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:37.881
Can't bust him out of prison.

00:53:38.632 --> 00:53:39.758

We can figure out
if we're missing anything.

00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:51.311
- Oh, my. Go!
- What?

00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:52.396
-Oh, what…
-Go back in!

00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:53.480
What is it? What? What?

00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:56.191
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
-What is it?

00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:58.569
What the hell is he doing here?

00:53:59.111 --> 00:54:00.612
- Who is it?
- Over there.

00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:03.824
That man. Bag over his arm? Sunglasses?

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.284
-Ya see him?
-Where?

00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:06.535
- Look.
- Oh.

00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:08.620
- Yeah, that guy?
- Yeah.

00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:09.913
- Yeah.
- Well, who is he?

00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:12.332
That's Professor Kim.

He's not a real one.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.714
He's just a con man.

00:54:18.797 --> 00:54:21.884
Only a few people in antiques know
who he really is.

00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:23.260
Wait, how do you know him then?

00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:25.763
Because
that damn son of a bitch scammed me.

00:54:25.846 --> 00:54:27.639
