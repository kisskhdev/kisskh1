This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.320
He wants Thun to fight Typhoon again,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.320
to give Typhoon a chance to redeem himself.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440
This was your doing, wasn’t it?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.840
Pakorn made a deal with Uncle Petch himself.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.760
I know now that you don’t want to fight Typhoon.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.560
Where have you been?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720
It's because of these two guys.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.960
My market is completely ruined!

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.560
You're under arrest

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.760
for fighting in public.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160
Sit down.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.640
Why are you arresting me, officer?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.040
Why don’t you go after those gang members instead?

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.040
Don’t try to run.
Why are you arresting us?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.880
Everyone involved will be brought in.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.920
Let us go right now!

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.400
How could you believe Muay's people?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.560
We’ll talk at the station.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.040
Officer.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.680
Officer, release us immediately!

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.280
Hey, you.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.800
Can you stop moving?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.560
It hurts.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.520
Then move with me.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.000
Why are you sitting like a rock?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120
Are you really going to keep causing problems?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.240
The only one causing problems right now is you.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.640
If you hadn’t gone emo and made me look for you,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.920
we’d still be at the academy, not in the back of a police car!

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.040
I never asked you to come after me.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Hey!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.760
Oh!

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.520
Okay, I won’t move.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
Go. get in.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.000
Get in.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.440
Officer, I think this is a misunderstanding.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.320
This is clearly a setup.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.320
No yelling or causing a scene.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.040
Calm down while you’re in here.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.960
Officer, unlock the handcuffs. Now!

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.120
Just wait! If I get out of here,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.440
I’ll sue everyone.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.720
Hey.
Officer!

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.520
Enough already.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.480
Officer!

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.520
Officer!

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.880
Why are you pulling me like that?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600
Stop shouting.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It’s not helping.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.960
I’m trying to figure out how to get us out of here.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.200
If you’re not going to help,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.000
then just sit quietly.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.320
You’re the one who kept making a scene.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.320
That’s why we got arrested.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320
It’s your fault, isn’t it?

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.200
If we can't find it.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.160
Do you know how much the Academy will be fined?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.080
All you ever think about is yourself and money?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.200
Yeah, it's all about the money.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.440
It’s my job.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.120
And what about your job?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.920
Aren’t you a boxer?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.600
Then why did you run from the match?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600
You’re such a coward.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.920
Who made me fight Typhoon?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.040
No one ever asked me what I wanted.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.120
I’m sorry,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.880
for making Prince of the Coconut fields,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.360
fight someone you didn’t want to.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.120
I really feel bad.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.360
How did you know about that?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.560
You disappeared without a word.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.560
I had to go to your house.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.040
This is getting too much.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.960
that you fucking around with my life.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.440
I just wanted to talk to you properly.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.120
I didn’t ask for this.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.440
I left because I wanted to be alone.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Stop interfering with my life.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.440
Learn your place!

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.200
The Heartless Left Hook.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.480
Ouch..

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.880
Stay still.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.160
It’ll hurt less.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.480
If we both move,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.080
we’ll both get hurt.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.800
I'm Sorry. You’re in pain too, right?

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.280
Yeah.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.960
I’m sorry.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.240
I didn’t mean to be harsh earlier.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I didn’t really mean it.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.760
It’s okay.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.160
What you said was true.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.120
I forced you into fighting Typhoon when you didn’t want to.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.320
Even if it wasn’t my idea,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.720
it still started with my lie.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840
I was wrong too.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.280
I knew you only did it because of the debt.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.640
So you’re saying we’re both at fault?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.480
As for the match, I’ll let you decide what to do.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480
I won’t push you this time.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.760
Keen.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.000
Huh?

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.080
Hi, Uncle Nop.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.880
What happened?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.880
How did you end up here?

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.400
It’s alright, I’ll handle your bail.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400
Uh, wait.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.720
Thank you.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.320
Thun.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.960
Where’ve you been?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.080
Everyone’s been looking for you.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.240
Well, I’m back now, aren’t I?

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.760
So that means you’re fighting again?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
I won’t be fighting.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.240
Sorry, Coach.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.480
Why not?

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.840
What the hell?

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.320
Thun?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.040
Let him go.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.720
I’ll go prep for tomorrow’s press conference.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.880
After what happened,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:32.000
Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.680
won’t be able to fight.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.400
I take full responsibility.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.960
Are you mad at me

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.960
that I’m not fighting?

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.680
It’s fine.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.800
If you had to force yourself to do it,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.040
it would’ve been worse.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.320
And the press conference.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.320
You really don’t want me to come with you?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.360
It’s fine, I can handle it.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.760
You going to bed?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.680
Yeah.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.800
Then I’ll head to the office to write.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.360
You can head to bed.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.760
You can stay here.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.000
I’ll sleep just fine.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.000
Sure.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.840
If you want to sleep, you can sleep on the bed.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.160
Sure, if you don’t take up the whole bed.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.080
Hey.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400
Hey.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.080
Hey.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.080
Go sleep properly.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.760
Hey.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960
Come here.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.960
Hey.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.000
Get up.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.200
Hello.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.800
I’m sure everyone here

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.320
is excited for the match between Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.760
and Typhoon Roaring Thunder, and so am I.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.440
However...

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:38.880
On behalf of Petchsak Academy, I must inform you

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.760
that Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon will not be fighting...

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.760
He will be fighting...

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.240
with Typhoon Roaring Thunder.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.040
And I urge you to stay tuned.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.840
(What?)

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.280
(Petchsak Academy...)

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.000
(Thun Tiger Taming Canon won’t be fighting...)

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.560
(...He will be fighting Typhoon Roaring Thunder.)

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.200
Hi, Coach.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.000
Oh, you’re back.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.160
Coach.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.400
Yes?

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.600
I’m sorry for running away before.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.680
It’s partly my fault too, for not asking you first.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.480
What made you decide to come back and fight?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.440
I want to face my own pain,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.560
so I don’t burden others anymore.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.960
Otherwise,

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.480
it’s just more painful for everyone.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.440
I’m sorry,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.320
I didn’t tell you directly from the start.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.960
It’s okay.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.800
Getting Thun to fight Typhoon again is amazing already.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.600
Coach.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.360
I’ll do better from now on.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.600
Thanks.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.400
Let the past be the past.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.520
Go get some rest.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.600
Back to training tomorrow.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.880
Thun, fighting!

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.400
Uncle Petch, someone just called asking to train with Thun.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.400
Do we have any courses?

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.040
Sure!

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.000
I’ve been meaning to for a while.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.200
Alright then.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.400
Yes, the academy is open for Muay Thai classes!

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.160
I’ll send the details soon.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.960
Sure.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.920
Hi everyone.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.000
Today, we’ll show you how to escape if someone pins you like this.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.360
If an attacker is trying to overpower you.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.560
How?

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.960
Like this.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.560
That’s the technique,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.200
Now I will try.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.600
You just have to use a bit more strength and you can do it.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.320
Yes!

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And that’s the proper way to do it.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.520
Go practice at home,

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.920
and if you want to learn more about defensive arts,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.600
you can contact Petchsak Academy anytime.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.600
We’ll leave it at that for now. Bye!

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.000
Where are you going?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.480
I’ll show you another move.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.000
No way, I’m tired today.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.480
You’re messing with me!

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.080
Hi everyone!

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.760
Today I’ll give you a room tour of a Muay Thai fighter’s dorm!

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.120
Let's check it out.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.120
Let's start out with the first bed.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:50.920
Here.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.800
Seems the owner’s not here.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.280
Let’s move to the next one.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.720
This bed’s still unclaimed.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.040
But if you want to become a muay thai fighter,

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.120
you can contact me.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.920
The number’s here.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.720
This is the third bed.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.720
Ah, someone’s here.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.600
Hi!

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.880
Come here.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.360
Hey there.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.320
Introduce yourself.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.040
I’m Ait.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.280
Ait here is one of our fighters.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.120
This is his bed.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.600
Super neat guy.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.240
Look at how tidy he keeps it, even living alone!

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.680
Oh!

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.640
You have a teddy bear?

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.000
Didn’t expect you to be the sweet type.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.840
This bear?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.320
That’s not mine.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.840
It’s my little sister’s.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.680
You have a sister?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.800
Yeah, her name’s Keaw.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.200
Here she is.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.840
This is her. Cute, right?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.560
She is!

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.040
Why haven’t I seen her at the academy?

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.040
She’s sick.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.640
Do you want to talk about it?

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.840
Yeah, of course.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.480
She’s waiting

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.640
for a heart transplant.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.240
It’s okay,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.480
she’s healthy right now.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.320
She’ll get a new heart soon.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.200
I’m not letting anything happen to her.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.200
So if anyone knows a great doctor or has advice,

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.880
share in the comments, I’ll read them all.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.600
That’s it for the live.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.520
Thanks for watching!

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.120
See you next time, bye!

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.800
Goodbye!

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.600
Bye!

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.200
Good bye.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.200
Thanks! See you around.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.800
You got this, man.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800
I’m fine.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.720
She's tougher than she looks.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.080
Was the clip alright?

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.800
Yeah, lots of viewers.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.240
People are commenting, too.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.960
(Can you handle it?)

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.160
Block it!

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.560
Yeah, like that.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:48.360
Coach, we’ve got more students now.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.200
We should rethink our class schedules

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.280
or we won’t be able to manage.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.440
Good idea.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.040
You handle it, Keen.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.200
Will do.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.040
Woah, bro.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.800
That's real salty.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.040
You’re a teacher now, how can you yawn like this?

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.720
Teach the students.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.800
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.640
I’m just sleepy.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.920
I saw an ad for Muay Thai lessons here?

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.920
How I do sign up ?

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.960
Uh... I...

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.320
Uh...I can speak English a little bit.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Break time.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.000
No problem.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.080
Sorry.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.640
Hey.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.920
Hey.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.800
I’m one of the instructors here.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.240
You wanna sign up?

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.520
That'd be great.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.600
I will get Keen.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.920
He can help you.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.960
He is here.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.960
Keen.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.280
Hi, welcome.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.520
Welcome to Petchsak Muay Thai Academy.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.600
What?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.000
Macadamia something?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.200
He's hungry?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.120
You want nuts?

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.800
Or are they sneaking off to eat again?

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.960
Come on, I'll get it for you.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.280
Hey?!

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Why just this much?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.560
You’re getting chubby, watch your weight.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.480
The scale’s broken,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.680
how do you know I gained weight?

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.320
Well, I'm too lazy want to walk a whole block weigh myself.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.800
You know it’s rude to comment on a woman’s weight, right?

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.960
But you’re a Muay Thai fighter.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.120
Well, who’d know?

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.080
Ait.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.320
Thanks, bro.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.320
Same for you, how many times do I have to remind you not to be drowsy midday?

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.560
If you’re that tired, cut back on your side jobs.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.680
Huh?

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.400
You know I can’t.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.240
I do, but you’re a coach now.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.480
Don’t ruin the academy’s name, okay?

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.920
Got it.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.080
No more dozing off.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.440
Take it.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.440
Thanks.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.600
You always give me something to nag about.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.040
So scary.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.760
Bro!

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.400
Search Thun’s name on your phone.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.080
Damn.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.120
Pakorn just called me.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.680
He said he’s pulling Thun out of the match.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.680
Shit.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.440
Ma'am, it’s not like what they’re saying in the news, I swear.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.280
Yes, ma’am. Please don’t worry.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.920
We’re being framed, that’s all.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.440
Yes, ma’am?

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.720
Hello?

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.560
Keen.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.840
It’s okay.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.840
I figured.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.360
Our gym just opened a new course, and now all the students have bailed.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.800
I’ll head to the market.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.800
Want to check something out.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.200
Isn’t it dangerous for you to go out like that?

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.040
I’ll go with him.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.200
Do you think this shop has CCTV?

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.160
There.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.000
You’re right.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.320
But we just trashed their shop…

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280
Will they even let us look?

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.480
Let’s try.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.560
Auntie.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.600
Can we see the security footage from that day, please?

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.720
You two were the ones from that day!

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.680
Why are you back? Here to wreck my shop again?

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.920
Get out! Don’t make me call someone to throw you out!

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.400
Go!

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.680
Go!

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.560
I said go!

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.760
Go!

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.840
Go!

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.600
Still not leaving?

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.680
Just go.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.600
Go.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.680
Here you go. Thanks, dear.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.880
Come again next time.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.960
Want some fruit?

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.600
Want some fruit?

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.680
What would you like?

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.240
Miss.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.400
Yes?
You were there that day, right?

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.920
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.400
You know we were set up?

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.080
No, I don’t.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.680
I know you saw it.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.840
I didn’t see anything.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.560
How could you not have?

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.400
I said I don’t know, go away.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.240
Please help me.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.200
I said I don’t know.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.880
Why won’t you say anything?

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.160
Calm down.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.320
We can check with other shops.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.480
Fine.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.160
Wait, wait.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.960
Come here a sec.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:47.240
Actually, I was there that day.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.520
Did you happen to record it?

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.040
I filmed it.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.880
But Muay

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.160
told us to delete everything.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.840
No one dares to go against her.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.080
I'm so sorry.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.840
But I really can’t help.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.520
What now?

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.520
Muay’s shutting every door on us.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.480
Calm down, we’ll find another way.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.040
Tiger Taming Canon Hello!

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.120
Hey.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.080
Remember me?

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.520
I’m Mai,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.840
the guy who took a picture with you the other day.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.320
Let me show you.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.520
Here, I was standing right here.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.240
Oh, right.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.360
Ring a bell?

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.960
Is there something going on?

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.600
Well, that's not my main point.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.680
I’ve got something to talk to you about.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.680
You remember the fight you were in, right?

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.200
I was recording at that exact moment.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.600
It captured everything,

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.600
so clearly.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.760
Didn’t Muay tell you to delete it?

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.760
Bro, come on.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.040
If I deleted the video,

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.520
why would I even tell you about it?

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.320
Can we have the clip, then?

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.560
Uh… no.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.720
What?

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.680
Calm down, my brother.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.000
I’ll post it myself.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.320
Just needs a little more editing.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.760
I’m in a hurry. Please?

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.160
Bro, chill, okay?

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.440
Here’s the deal.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.840
Once I finish editing, I’ll post it for you.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:03.240
But I have one condition.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.200
Sis, I sent you the link.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.480
Please help fix the story.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.480
Thanks.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.640
(Can I give you a hug, bro?)

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.240
(Sure thing.)

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.600
(Man, thank you so much!)

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.800
You’re the coolest.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.480
You’re my idol.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.320
From the drama involving “Thun Tiger Taming Canon”

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.760
a.k.a. Thun Sukkasem,

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.120
who appeared in a viral video fighting in a fresh market,

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.800
which led to the #BoxerThug controversy.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.240
Thun faced heavy criticism

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.760
about whether he’s fit to be a professional boxer.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.560
But then the tide turned when an influencer

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.120
released another angle of the video

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.360
revealing Thun didn’t start the fight.
(Hey.)

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.680
revealing Thun didn’t start the fight.
(You’d better be ready.)

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.040
In fact, he was trying to protect someone from getting attacked.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.880
(Let go!)

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.760
Now, the hashtag #HeroBoxer

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.840
is trending number one in Thailand,

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.040
praising Thun for his bravery and kindness.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.200
And of course, people are swooning over Thun’s good looks.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.880
(We’ll have to wait and see how Pakorn responds to this.)

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.080
Keen, you're surprisingly good at crisis-solving.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.640
It’s nothing, but Klao!

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.040
She’s amazing, smart, pretty, and kind.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.240
She helped us by correcting the news.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.040
So how did you run into that kid?

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.880
Bumped into him at the noodle shop with Keen.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.400
Turns out he’s a fan of Thun Tiger Taming Canon.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.280
Oh, a fan?

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.120
Then why not let him help promote the gym?

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.000
Not a bad idea.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.920
You serious?

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.240
He’s got a ton of followers, right?

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.400
Could make the gym famous.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.480
Ahem!

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.760
Oh,

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.520
it’s the influencer kid!

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.560
Hi, bro!

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.440
Hi, P’Thun!

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.160
Hello.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.240
My name’s Mai.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.640
He helped post the video

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.840
in exchange for becoming a fighter at our gym.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.640
I’ve already talked to Uncle Phet.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.920
So from now on, Mai will be part of our gym.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.640
Huh?

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.360
You totally called it, Bung.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.040
Yeah.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.680
The discourse is changing.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.280
Look, people are starting to support Thun again.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.600
Your efforts paid off, Keen.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.560
More students will probably sign up now.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.360
I was just joking earlier.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.120
By the way, does this kid even know how to fight?

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120
Can he handle it?

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.160
Uh…

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:08.600
Don’t worry, I’ll train him myself.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.800
Your protégé, huh?

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.800
Guess we’d better start training him to get in shape.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.840
Your name’s Mai, right?

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.680
Yes.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.360
Come with me, I’ll show you the gym

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.400
and the room you’ll be sharing with me.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.080
Let’s go.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.840
Coming, thank you.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.840
You think he’ll make it?

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.400
So, you know how to do nice things?

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.640
So what’s next?

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.720
Now we just talk to them.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.920
Anyway, let’s eat.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.640
Yeah, let’s eat.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.960
Let’s eat.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.400
Kid.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.800
Pakorn is ready to see you, follow me.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.680
I think you need to change your statement.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:00.280
First of all, I have to commend you for handling the crisis well.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.280
But tell me..

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.080
Why should I do what you ask?

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.160
Because it’s what the audience wants.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.680
You know how popular Thun is right now.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.880
Your decision will affect your future, too.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.000
This isn’t a one-sided deal.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.160
It’s a win-win for both of us.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.720
So that’s all you came here for?

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.720
Yes.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.440
And I hope that a top promoter like yourself

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.360
will choose the right path.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.360
Will the Tiger Taming Canon get to fight again?

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.360
Yes! Will he?

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.360
What do you say?

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:58.000
Mr. Pakorn, are you really going to bar someone who helped others from competing again?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:58.840
Yeah!

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.000
Right?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.360
Please answer!

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:01.920
Tell us, please!

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.280
So what’s the decision?

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.640
Right, I’m here to tell everyone..

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.200
I’ve contacted Thun Tiger Taming Canon to fight Typhoon Roaring Thunder

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:17.280
in the upcoming event, please look forward to this grudge match!

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.960
I promise it’ll be worth the wait!

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.800
What are you doing here?

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.880
Why aren’t you in bed yet?

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.960
I'm waiting…

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.200
For my roommate.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.640
Something on your mind?

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.560
You don’t have to be chained together like in the cell

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.920
just to open up, right?

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.360
What are you feeling right now?

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.080
I want to say thank you.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.120
Thank you for what?

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.520
Thank you for....

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.520
Making my life better.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.320
It wasn’t just because of me.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.040
It’s because we all helped each other.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.480
How could I take all the credit?

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.440
And also...

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.160
The fact that we're still together.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.200
Still solving problems together.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.320
Everything will get better soon.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:08.000
Please turn to face each other for a moment.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.000
Let’s scoot a little closer.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.560
A bit more.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.720
This time, I’m going to teach you what it means to lose,

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.720
Thun.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.080
You're really good at massages.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.400
Don’t tease me.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.800
You were criticizing me so much earlier.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.680
Sorry for being harsh.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.120
Are you mad?

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.600
A little bit.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.400
But I get where you were coming from.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:28.800
From now on, I’ll try to manage my time better.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.040
I’m not done with the massage yet.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.720
How's your massage work going these days?

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.240
Any problems?

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:58.160
I’m good, I’m happy with how things are going.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.160
Though I get some weird clients sometimes,

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.400
It’s not a big deal.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.320
You booked for extra service?

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.480
You still haven’t figured it out?

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.160
Thanks for dropping me off every time.

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.880
Don’t mention it.

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.520
You’d better hurry, I’ll catch up with you later.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.160
Okay.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.960
Everything will get better.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.480
But before you take care of your sister,

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.480
You need to take care of yourself first.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.560
If you don’t, and you let yourself get tired,

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.560
How will you have the energy to take care of her?

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.640
Okay.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.040
Thanks.

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.000
I’ll head in now.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.720
Alright.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.440
Huh?

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.760
Keaw,

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.720
Did you know someone who follows our page

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.640
Has connections at Ekkarin Hospital?

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:20.000
You're getting both a new heart and a new hospital!

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.920
Really?

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.360
Yay!

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.960
Congrats, keaw. You’re getting a new heart!

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.760
Hello, Mawin.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.600
Congrats, Keaw. I hope everything goes smoothly.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.600
Thanks.

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.280
It’s bedtime now, sweetheart.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.000
Say bye-bye to the big brothers.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.680
P’Ait, P’Mawin, I’m going to sleep now.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.920
Bye-bye!

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.280
Bye-bye, keaw. Sweet dreams.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.680
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye, keaw.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.880
Get lots of rest.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.360
Can I talk to P’Ait for a bit?

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.640
Oh, sure.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.000
Mr.Ait,

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.480
Next week, could you come in to handle the patient transfer paperwork?

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.400
Of course.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.240
Thank you so much.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.280
Sure.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.000
Let’s go to bed.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.040
Okay.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.440
Congrats, man.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.360
So happy for you.
You don’t have to worry about your sister anymore.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.880
Congratulations, P’Ait.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.520
Thanks, you guys.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.600
Yay, such a relief.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.000
This calls for a celebration, right?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.720
Let me think...

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.200
What should we eat?

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.160
Tell me what you want, I’ll hop on my bike and grab it for you.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:26.680
What should we eat?

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.840
Somtum?

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.640
Somtum?

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.760
Sure!
Or maybe hot pot?

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.560
Hmm… I kinda want somtum.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.520
Let’s ask P’Ait.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.600
P’Ait, what do you feel like eating?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.320
Are you treating?

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.640
Of course! Gotta treat for something worth celebrating.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.720
Then salmon.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.480
Huh?

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
Hey.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.760
So..

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.240
Thanks for helping with Keaw’s heart situation.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.240
All I did was spread the word.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.240
And Ait too.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.080
If you hadn’t filmed in that bedroom that day, none of this would’ve happened.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.200
In the end, everyone helped.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.920
Wait, you know how to smile?

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.320
I’m not smiling.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.680
Come on, let me see your smile.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.560
Let me see it.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.040
No.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.560
Just once.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.160
No.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.320
Just a quick smile.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:57.840
No.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.000
Thun, smile for me.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:01:59.480
No.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.400
Give me a sweet smile.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.560
What do you think I am?

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.280
You look like someone heartless.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.200
Like that nickname, The Heartless Left Hook.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.200
I smiled at you so many times,

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.200
you just didn’t notice.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.200
Really?

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:32.360
Then I guess your left hook isn’t heartless after all.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.280
Wanna find out if I’m truly heartless?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.440
I don't want to lose anymore.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.320
Can I increase the dose?

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.760
But you know, if the medicine wears off, it'll be painful.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.440
I know.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.720
Fight!

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.720
Thun, fight him!

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.080
Thun, do it.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.200
Fight, Thun!

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.800
Don't let your hands drop!
