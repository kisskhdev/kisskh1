00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.240
And...

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.160
if it's a pre-fight training,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.480
is it like a regular training?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.520
Well,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.440
regular training,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.000
but with a bit of weight control.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.920
Why are you asking about training?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.440
I found a match for you.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.240
When?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.920
Next month.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.320
With whom?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.880
With whom?

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.040
If it's him,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.640
I won't fight.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.720
Wait.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.960
Hey.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.520
Wait.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.160
You're so good that no one wants
to fight with you anymore.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.680
Typhoon is the only opponent
who totally matches up with you.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.560
Stop being selfish, Thun.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.720
Listen.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.920
In this camp, you're the one
with the highest earnings.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.440
The camp will earn more money.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.760
I'm doing this for the camp,
and also for you.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.320
If this camp gets more fame,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.960
jobs will pour in.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.320
Trust me.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.720
No.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080
I will never.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.440
You two aren’t going to bed yet?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.880
We're about to go, Uncle Petch.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.320
Excuse me.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.760
=Knock Out The Series=

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.040
(Don't Hold Back)

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.400
Just get in the ring with Typhoon.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.640
I don't see any harm in it.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.400
No.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.120
Wait.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.520
Aren't you gonna sleep here?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.920
Stop. Following. Me.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.440
(Petchsak Boxing Camp)

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.040
How did you get here?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.600
You kept running in the same place.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.000
But I’m glad...

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.840
That you finally see me as a rival.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.880
Who's your rival?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.160
That’s not gonna happen.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.920
The two of us will never meet like this again.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.200
Why...?

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.080
Do you really not want to fight me that much...?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.240
How long are you gonna look down on me?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.040
I’m so damn disappointed in you.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.600
You’ve never changed,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.760
still selfish as hell.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.320
Win, Have you seen Thun?

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.440
First of all,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.160
how could you not know
the boxing training schedule?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.680
Here it is.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.400
If you want to work at the boxing camp,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.920
you must know this.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.000
But it's already past his roadwork time.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.680
Why hasn't Thun returned yet?

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.080
I don't know.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.280
Maybe he's hyped.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.440
He's going to fight Typhoon anyway.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.520
By the way,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.120
how did you convince Thun

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.040
to get him to agree to fight?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.280
By the way,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.760
before Thun and Typhoon had a fight,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.440
were those two very close?

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.360
There.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.560
They were always stuck together,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.840
whether eating or bathing.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.160
The room where you sleep,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.680
they used to be there together.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.680
I think those two

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.560
maybe...

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.400
Well...

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.120
Thun.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.680
Keen.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.680
What's wrong with him?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.760
Hey.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.920
Listen to me first, alright?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.320
I really do this for everyone.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.440
Could you please think it over again?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.720
If you agree to fight...

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.840
Just stop talking.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.480
I'm gonna fight with Typhoon.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.640
Are you for real?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.240
Why did you change your mind?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.040
Okay.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.400
43.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.840
44.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.960
45.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.640
Another five revs.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.880
Come on, one, two.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.440
Keep your hands up.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.120
One, two.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.800
One, two, bro. Come on.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.320
One more round.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.480
More strength.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.440
- One, two.
- Keep your hands up. Guards up.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.360
Okay.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.280
One, two.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.600
One, two.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.480
Go. Let's call it a day for now.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.360
You can go rest.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.720
We're done, Boong. Quick.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.800
Here you go.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.320
For me?

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.400
- Thank you.
- What?

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.120
46.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.400
47.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.320
48.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.720
49.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.320
50.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.040
Okay.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.840
Are you alright, bro?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.760
Let's continue to second set.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.520
Go on.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.960
Aww, you.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.040
That hurts, you know.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.200
If you want to help,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.760
just get out of my way.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.680
(Battle of Roaring Tigers)

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.880
160 pounds, passed.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.320
I'm nervous.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.040
This is my first time watching a match.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.920
Hello.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.160
Welcome all the audience to

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.880
the Battle of Roaring Tigers.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.200
And our main fighters today

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.400
are very talented boxers

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.360
who everyone is eagerly waiting for.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.440
And if you guys are ready,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.680
please make some noise
and give a round of applause

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.440
for Team Blue,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.800
Thun, Tiger Taming Cannon,
Protege of Petchsak.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.160
Go ahead, Thun.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.520
(Battle of Roaring Tigers)
The owner of the nickname "Heartless Left Punch"

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.760
Thun has not fought for a long time.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.640
Tonight, he has returned
to the ring once again.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.520
And I heard that

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.640
he's been training

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.000
to get fit, especially for this fight.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.600
Alright, we've already got
the blue team, so

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.960
please make some noise and give
a round of applause once again

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.800
for our Team Red,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.480
Typhoon Roaring Sky
from P. White Tiger Camp.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.280
Typhoon's secret weapon is his ability to

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.680
get in close.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.440
What's interesting is that

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.960
these two boxers

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.680
were once in the same boxing camp.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.680
So, tonight's Battle of Roaring Tigers

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.840
must be exciting

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.040
and crazy.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.200
Hello, sir.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.320
I bet 32.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.560
33, 32.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.640
I bet 32.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.000
Take it easy, and don't rush.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.320
Good luck.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.520
Take it easy.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.440
Be careful.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.520
Keep your guard up, Thun.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.040
Why are you doing this?

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.560
What did I do?

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.680
Can you stop holding back for me?

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.120
Let me go.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.360
What's wrong with you, Typhoon?

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.640
I can only be the second,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.520
just your shadow.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.280
Let me go.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.720
Why do you think that way?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.360
You don't have to pretend
you know nothing.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.120
I know what you're thinking.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.040
I don't know how I'm gonna be number one

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.400
if I'm still here.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.720
I’m moving out to another camp.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.840
One.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.160
Two.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.760
Three.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.680
Four.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.320
Five.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.000
Six.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.800
Seven.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.680
Eight.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.160
Come on, Blue, ready.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.920
Fight.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.080
Thun, back off.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.560
Stop, stop, stop, separate.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.840
Ready, fight.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.320
Thun, focus.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.880
Why

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.960
have you never shared

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.360
how you feel?

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.280
Do people here ever mean anything to you?

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.520
Thun.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.400
Take a deep breath.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.240
Take a deep breath, man.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.240
Don’t you rush.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.560
Take it easy.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.280
Get serious now, Typhoon.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.240
I think Thun is acting strange.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.920
Overdoing it.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.280
Seems into it.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.520
Is it because Thun knows Typhoon's tactics,

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.240
so he wants to wrap up the game quickly?

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.880
It's never been like this.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.480
No matter with whom.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.520
Thun,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.200
don't let your feelings
get the best of you.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.480
Understand?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.240
Let me go.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.080
Let me go.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.880
- Let me go.
- Typhoon.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.800
Let me go.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.360
What can I do

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.240
to keep you here with me?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.800
You

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.080
never understand anything.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.560
I've never seen you as a rival, man.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.520
If you really want to be the god damn number one,

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.720
you can get it, but...

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.920
Don’t you fucking dare hand it to me.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.400
I will be there by myself.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.440
And if the two of us are
on the same ring again,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.360
don’t ever hold back.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.600
What about me, Typhoon?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.000
If you go,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.640
I will never fight with you again.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.200
Typhoon.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.120
Typhoon.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.840
This is the fourth round.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.320
Hang in there for a moment.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.520
Good, bro. Keep going.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.960
Go for it.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.160
Go ahead, Thun.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.080
One.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.520
Two.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.960
Three.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.200
Four.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.480
Five.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.000
Oh, Thun! Thun!

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.360
- Thun!
- Great job, my man.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.360
Thun!

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.840
What's happening, bro?

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.000
Why are people booing?

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.960
Thun didn't break the rules.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.320
It's nothing.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.160
Just the boxing gamblers
haven’t have time to play.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.160
The game is over.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.040
Thun winning is just enough, right?

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.120
Come on, eat.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.480
Eat until you're full,
but if not, just refill.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.800
Today, it’s on me.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.120
He treats us once in a while.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.160
It smells good.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.440
Oh, It.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.160
Are you heading for work?

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.480
Eat before you go.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.400
Don't you want to celebrate
Thun's winning a little bit?

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.080
Come on in.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200
Come on. Come on.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.440
I got it for you.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.920
That's alright, bro.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.720
Bro, go ahead and eat.
I'll get it by myself.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.920
Come on.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.600
You have to go soon, It.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.920
Take it as a thank you

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.520
for being Thun's corner boy today.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:53.840
Dig in.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.720
- Thank you,
- Um.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.400
Dive in.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.760
Oh, Thun, come look at this.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.920
A lot of comments here.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.320
Boxing fans love to watch
your fight with Typhoon.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.800
Did you see the shot
where you knocked him out?

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.160
So beautiful, let me find the clip.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.640
It's alright.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.280
I saw it already.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.760
Here it is.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.520
Keen,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.280
you too.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.720
Dive in.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.760
So, you'd have the energy to find jobs
for Thun again.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.240
Eat up.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.680
Hey, what are you looking at?

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.000
Falling down.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.000
I'll refill it for you.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.520
Do you like anything in particular?

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.320
Do you like pork?

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.080
Or do you like chicken?

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.600
Or do you like shrimp?

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.760
Why do you even ask?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.440
Whatever I like or dislike,

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.080
I can't choose for myself anyway.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.000
Are you good? Huh? Not finished yet.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.200
Why?

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.560
You can't have everything, Boong.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.160
I want everything.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.120
But I don't have this one yet.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.720
Keen,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.800
please go find Dad for me.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.400
He's been on the phone for a long time.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.040
Okay, got it.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.480
This is the last one.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.800
Here you go.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.680
Why not? Why can't I put it on?
It looks cool.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.400
Really?

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.320
Will you really wear this?

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.120
Can I have three hundred fifty thousand?

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.000
Alright, then, next month.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.400
Yes, sir. Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.320
Thank you, sir.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.520
Keen,

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.400
it's good you came.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.200
Here's your share.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.480
Thank you, Uncle Petch.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480
Come on, I have to thank you too.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.280
I was talking to Pakorn just now.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.720
He wants Thun and Typhoon to fight again.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.240
Let Typhoon have a rematch.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.920
So,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.640
what did you say
to Mr. Pakorn?

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.280
Well, I made the deal.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.840
It's three hundred and fifty thousand.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.120
You made the deal?

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.640
Yes, I did.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.520
But, I think we should ask Thun first.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.440
Let Thun decide

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.040
whether he wants to fight Typhoon or not.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.120
Come on, don't think too much.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.840
Thun will fight anyway.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.360
But Uncle Petch,

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.000
- I think...
- It's fine.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.000
I'll go and talk to Thun by myself.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.480
Okay, go.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.960
Go, go, go.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.000
The last piece,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.520
can I have it? I haven't eaten
a single piece yet.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.240
Fine, you paid for the meal after all.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.280
Hey, everybody,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.720
I have good news for you.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.720
Thun,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.320
he will get to fight again next month.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.320
Let Typhoon redeem himself.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.440
I've requested Thun's fee of 350,000,

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.440
and Pakorn doesn't negotiate at all.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.280
Then we will be rich, Dad.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.600
Yes.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040
Oh, Thun.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.040
The day after tomorrow,
there will be a press conference.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.480
Get yourself ready.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.000
Keen, thank you very much

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.240
for finding a match for Thun every month.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:47.640
Thun,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.160
what's wrong with you?

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.680
I’ll go get him.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.680
What's wrong with Thun?

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:02.760
I don't know. Forget about it.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.600
Let's eat, Dad.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.960
Come, come, come, come.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.960
Today, I'll treat you guys.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.560
Hey.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.840
Hey.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.600
It's you again, right?

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.120
It's not.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.800
Just hear me out first, okay?

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.760
How much will you be getting this time?

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.520
Mr. Pakorn himself called
and talked with Uncle Petch.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.880
I have no idea.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.480
I know you don't want to fight Typhoon.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.760
I will find a way to talk
to Uncle Petch for you.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.120
Okay?

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.440
I’ll keep my eye on you.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.480
Hey.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.560
Hey.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.920
(Loan Shark Bitch)

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.160
I knew

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.280
that you didn't do as I told you.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.360
I thought I could take down
Thun all by myself.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.200
Don't ruin the camp's reputation,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.000
because of your thoughtlessness.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.080
I apologize.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.480
Next time,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.880
if you don't want to see
yourself in this state,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.640
you know

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560
what you have to do, right?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.120
All set, Ms. Muay.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.000
60,000 for this installment.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.400
You can make it. See?

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.800
So, today

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.640
I'll let you go home gracefully.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.360
No need to get hurt.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.800
Wait.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.760
Early next month,

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.920
be on time and complete, okay?

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.000
I'm sorry. The number
you've dialed is not available.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.920
He's turned off the phone.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:19.920
What's going on?

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.440
Keen,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.960
isn't Thun with you?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.560
Seems like Thun has disappeared.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.080
He didn't pick up the phone,

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.480
hung up,

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.240
and now he's even turned off his phone.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.600
What's wrong with him?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.360
It's about the fight with Typhoon.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.520
Uncle Petch, I've told you that

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.840
we should have talked to Thun first.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.240
So, are you saying that

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.080
he ran away because he didn't want
to fight Typhoon?

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.280
Why did they fight yesterday?

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.280
Don't tell me

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.200
that you made a deal with Pakorn

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.360
without Thun’s consent?

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.920
Keen,

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.920
I warned you.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.280
So, how's it now?

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.320
Ruined.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.760
All ruined.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.680
If I were you, I wouldn't stay.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.840
Next time,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.080
think before you do anything, okay?

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:44.800
So,

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.680
what if we call to cancel the fight now?

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.520
Keen.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.000
Don't you know about the cancellation
fines for the match?

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.200
Where will we get the money to pay?

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.920
Win.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.520
How are you going
to take responsibility for this?

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.120
Calm down, bro.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.200
- Answer me.
- Win.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.320
- Win.
- Hey, stop!

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:08.840
That's enough.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.840
Let's put the match
cancellation aside for now.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.760
Now, let's find him first.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.280
We still have some time.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.040
I'll go find Thun and bring him back.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.680
He hasn't even picked up the phone,

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.400
so how are you going to find him?

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.400
Everybody, calm down for now.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.000
Think about it slowly.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.200
If Thun's gonna run away,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.640
where would he go?

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.160
Home.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.720
Home, maybe.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.920
Probably not.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.760
But, should we try calling first?

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.560
Wait.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.120
Well,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.840
that lady said

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.560
Thun isn't here.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.320
Then, why did we come
all this way to find him.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.000
She said he's not here,

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.680
and cut me off quickly..

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.360
It looks suspicious, Sis.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.720
He may be really not here.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.320
Ahh, I get it now.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.800
Because he's handsome, right?

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.720
That's why you go to such lengths!

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.160
We came all the way here.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.120
Well,

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.880
I'm really to be blamed for this.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.880
Stop complaining.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.080
Wow! I haven't even started complaining.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.880
Not only his mother,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.720
but you also look suspicious too.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.240
Wow, this is now a jungle, Keen.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.880
This place resembles those in the dramas
we watched when we were kids, Sis.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.160
True enough.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.560
Tiger Taming Cannon.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.280
He comes from a wealthy
family, doesn't he?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.040
Why did he become boxer for a living?

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.560
It's obviously more comfortable
to stay home.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.800
I already told you, he's not here.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.720
Hello.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.280
We have to

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.920
apologize to you, Mrs. Thida.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.240
- I'm Sorry.
- I'm Sorry.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.040
Uncle Petch said that

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.560
Thun has never stayed overnight
or gone somewhere far away.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.080
So, I thought Thun might come back home.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.200
Since the day Thun left home
over ten years for boxing.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.800
He has never come back.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.120
Once Thun has decided something,

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.880
don't expect him to change his mind.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.800
By the way, you said yourself that
Thun is always at the camp.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.280
So, what made him run away?

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.400
Well...

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.440
You?

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.640
Well,

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.040
I just came to the camp.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320
As far as I know,

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.960
Thun doesn't have any boxing matches.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.400
And now, we’ve had a misunderstanding.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.720
- So, he...
- So it's really because of you.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.840
If Thun comes back here,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.480
could you please contact us?

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.040
No.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.720
Because Thun must not return
to the ring ever again.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.560
If you've finished your business,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.360
off you go.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.960
Hey, Phoon.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.880
That belt is so damn cool.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:53.720
Wanna try it on?

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.040
Come on, I’ll put it on you and let you try it out.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:56.960
It fits perfectly.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.720
No, it’s okay.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.360
That’s yours,

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.240
not mine.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.400
It belongs to both of us.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.760
If it weren’t for you,

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.640
I wouldn’t have made it here.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.200
Right?

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.200
Yeah.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.360
Go pack your stuff.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.200
Before they come kick us out.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.240
Alright.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.200
Let me look at it one more time.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.240
Whoa, it’s beautiful.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:21.760
Look at it.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.280
You’re a real champion.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.240
Champion of MPS, man!

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.240
It’s freaking awesome.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.440
I’m gonna sleep hugging it all night.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.960
You done? I’m heading out.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.240
Yeah, go on.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:45.960
Jab.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.400
One, two.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:48.800
One, two, hook.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.760
Good, try all the styles.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.080
- Give me a set of punches.
- Try all the styles. Work on your knee, too.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:53.760
One, two.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.160
- Yeah.
- Good.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:56.960
One, two.

What?

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.360
Is it about Thun, Coach?

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.240
It’s nothing.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.480
Keep practicing. There's nothing wrong.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.200
Keep practicing.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.720

Are you okay?

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.160
I don't know, Sis.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.760
Am I selfish

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.040
in trying to search for Thun?

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.320
If you did anything without a good reason,

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.800
I would’ve stopped being friends with you.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.040
So, if it happens that

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.840
we find Thun,

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.160
we would figure it out together.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.080
As for Mr. Pakorn,

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.520
he may not charge for the cancellation fee.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.360
Don't worry too much yet.

What is it now?

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.200
I found Thun. He's at the market.

(CG A Photo of Mhai with Thun)

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.960
Which market? Do you have a map?

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.160
Sri Raya Fresh Market.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.440
Do you know it?

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.280
No, I don't.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.120
Wait. I'll search for it.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.440
- Can you open the map and check?
- Yeah.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.920
You go straight ahead, Sis.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.720
The map indicates
20 more minutes to arrive.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.920
Okay, okay.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.200

Is this the alley?

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.440
Yes, that's it.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.240
Sri Raya Fresh Market, here it is.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.480
Okay, I'll swing around
and drop you off in front.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.120
Are you sure you can go alone?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.960
You go to work, Sis.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.680
I can go alone. Don't worry.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.040
Okay, let me know

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:13.920
if you want me to pick you up.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.960
So, I'll go now.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.640
Drive safely, Sis.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.280
I'm sorry.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.400
(MP Phuwish Detkriangkrai)

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.240
(Member of the Thai Phakpoom Party)

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.000
(confirmed pushing
for Muay Thai sports policy)

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.440
(to become the International Soft Power)

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.760
(along with going to the area
to talk with boxers)

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.960
(to inquire about issues that
they would like the government)

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
(to help take care of.)

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.480
Come on.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.760
Look where you’re going.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.640
I’m trying to record a video here.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.520
Oh, Sister.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.480
I'm recording a video.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.840
Will this ever be done?

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.320
I’ve gone over this ten times.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.080
You.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.760
It's you, bro.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:11.880
Do you remember me?

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.600
We met at the temple.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.680
At the funeral.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.280
By the way,

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.800
what are you doing here?

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.480
I have something to ask.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.600
Yes, bro.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.520
Did you see Thun?

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080
Yes, I saw him, bro.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.840
So,

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.600
where did he go now?

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.280
Did you see that?

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.720
Thun, right?

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.080
That way, bro.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:32.880
That way.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.880
But, I'm not sure whether

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.480
left or right, but

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.760
you can try to walk that way first, bro.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.080
- This way, right?
- Yes, bro.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.480
Huh? That's all?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:41.960
Got your answer and drifted.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.920
I would’ve done my video ages ago.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.360
When will it be finished?

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.640
Go.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.440
I'm sorry, bro. I'm so sorry.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.040
Please go ahead.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.680
I keep meeting strange people today.
What's going on?

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.160
I gotta go.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.840
Hey.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.120
The thugs are following you.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.120
Where have you been?

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.200
Why do you want to know?

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.040
Everyone is worried about you.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.960
Think about other people's feelings.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.320
You have to think about my feelings too.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:49.960
You...

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.240
What's up, Keen?

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.800
You came to my place here.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.480
So, you've got the money for me, right?

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.920
Didn't you say next month?

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.680
I just want it now.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.120
Pay up.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.200
Now that you're here...

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:11.800
Fuck off.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.480
Oh, what do you mean?

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.360
So, you don't have it?

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.960
Boys.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.280
Hey, come here.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.120
Where are you going?

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.560
Follow them.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.000
Teach him a lesson.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.880
You little shit.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920
I’m gonna get my money back.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.720
Just you wait.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.320
Hey.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.440
Let me take a break.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.160
You know you'll get in trouble
if you’re out here.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.320
But here you are.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.280
Hey.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.640
I came out looking for you.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.120
Go, he's over there.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.600
You rats are fast.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.080
What's this, what's going on, Mai?

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.200
I don't know, either.

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.760
Looks like some folks are having a fight.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.680
Who are they?

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.200
Let me go!

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.120
Back off!

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.040
You better stop.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.480
- Let me go.
- Let him go.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.040
Let's go back to the camp.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.000
No.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.760
Huh? What do I have to say
to make you come back?

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.120
Officer, I found them!

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.520
Officer, over there. He's there, sir.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.880
Hey, go now!

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:52.920
Morons!

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.080
Ah, Ms. Muay.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.680
She’s collecting her debts for sure.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.560
It's because of these two guys.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.160
My market is completely ruined now.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.440
That's right.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.280
You have to deal with
this seriously, officer.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.160
and I can’t continue selling today anymore.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.200
Hey, aunty!

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.520
What the hell did you just say?

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.920
We haven't done anything yet.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.880
Open your eyes and see
whether you did or not.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.040
Everything is ruined now. Watch it.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.080
You are under arrest.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.720
Charges of fighting

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.520
and damaging others' properties.

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.720
Sergeant, cuff them.

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.720
Let's go. We can talk later at the station.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.960
Aah! Everything has been ruined.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.880
Who's gonna take responsibility?

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.960
I didn't do anything wrong, officer.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.000
You scumbags.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.200
Cuff them all.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.040
Let's talk later at the police station.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.120
Hey, officer.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.080
Hey, you.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.640
Can you stop making a fuss?

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:51.640
It hurts.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:53.760
Hey.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.440
Stay still.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.880
If we both move, we'll both end up hurting.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.480
If you want to sleep, you can come lie on the bed.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.240
I’m trying to fight the wounds in my own heart.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.520
I’ll teach you the other move later.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.360
Ait has a younger sibling?

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.960
Why have I never seen them at the camp?

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.240
My younger sibling’s sick.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.000
Things will get better soon.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.560
Just now, Pakorn called the coach.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.600
He said he’s pulling Thun out of the competition.
