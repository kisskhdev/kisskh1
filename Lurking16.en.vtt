00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.640
Nian, you're awake.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.960
How are you?

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.679
Do you feel uncomfortable?

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.000
What about the arsonists?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.200
They turned themselves in.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.759
But the leader said

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.640
he just wanted to scare you.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.960
He never expected
the warehouse to catch fire.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.719
Did he tell you who instigated it?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.439
I can tell you.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280
You seduced her fiancé.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.640
(Wei Qing?)

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.079
Nian,

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:19.439
stop investigating.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.519
If I hadn't arrived in time

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.680
to get you out of the warehouse,

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:25.760
you'd have died.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.319
It was you

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.879
who saved me?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.040
(Was it my imagination?)

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.840
Nian,

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:48.719
give me a chance.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.760
I want to be with you and protect you.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.640
This is your mother's wish too.

I need to have a word with him.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.039
Please go out first.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.520
Okay.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.520
I know it was Wei Qing
who instructed them.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.960
I recorded it this time.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.120
Listen to it.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.039
I'll call the police

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.439
unless you take me to Zhao Yan.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.000
It's your choice.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.759
Gu Nian,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.319
can you not be so stubborn?

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.919
I'll call the police.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.199
If you don't want any trouble,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.039
take me to see Zhao Yan soon.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.240
Since you're so persistent,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.919
meet me at this place tonight.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.560
Wait.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.879
During the warehouse fire,

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.400
were you there?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.919
I wasn't.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.000
Brother, why are you here?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.039
I hope the warehouse thing

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.079
won't happen again.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.040
How could you speak to me
like this for that woman?

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:21.839
If you dare hurt her again,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.240
I'll...

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.879
What?

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.839
Will you kill your sister

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360
because of her?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.079
Don't forget,

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.839
you're the one
who got her mother killed.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.439
What do you think will happen
if she ever finds out?

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.240
I've won, haven't I?

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.920
The people here are dangerous.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.240
I'm not responsible
for anything that happens.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.360
I don't need you to be.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.600
Sir, this is a private area.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.040
Please go.

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.240
A Premium Card?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.600
Go ahead.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.319
Please come inside.

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.399
What did you give him?

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.040
The owner here is a know-it-all.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.920
This card can make him do anything.

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.120
Stop playing.

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:26.800
If something happens later,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.759
leave when I say so.

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.279
What about you?

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.600
Mind your own business.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.160
Who is this?

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:40.319
It's been a long time,

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:41.680
K.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.000
You're mistaken.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.199
I'm not K.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.360
You're not K?

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.079
Then why do you have this card?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.680
I've given this card to two people.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.240
If you're not him,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.480
then who are you?

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.639
I'm with the Wei family.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.199
The Wei family?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.439
So you're

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.040
the new head of the Wei family.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.839
You really look like K.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.639
I thought he had come back to life.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.639
And you're...

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.839
I'm his fiancée.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:43.240
So you're Miss Wei.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.360
But,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.560
from how I remember Miss Wei,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.160
you look a bit

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.519
different.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.759
What?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.160
Why so serious?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.079
I was just going to say,

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.040
Miss Wei seems to have gotten prettier.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.079
Let's talk business.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.519
I'm here for Zhao Yan.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.920
That's strange.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.439
Lately, everyone
has been asking me for Zhao Yan.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.480
Name your price.

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.000
With so many people after him,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.160
it's not just about money anymore.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560
How about

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.839
you trade something precious
to you with me?

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:37.480
For example,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.279
Miss Wei.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.800
Your casino in the southeast

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.839
is under my control.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.240
If you don't want
to lose this place too,

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.319
I suggest you comply.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.639
Are you sure Zhao Yan is here?

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.519
You can just go in
and see for yourselves.

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:45.879
Kun?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.720
Gu Nian,

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:49.200
K,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.360
I'm not dead.

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:53.120
You must be upset, right?

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:56.679
I know you're looking for Zhao Yan.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:59.159
So I spread the rumor that he's here

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.559
to lure you out.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.360
Surprised, aren't you?

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:04.320
Let's go.

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:11.320
Get them.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:11.799
Yes,

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:12.360
Kun.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.639
Kun,

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.799
this isn't Tai City.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.240
If you do anything to us,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.399
the police won't let you off.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:22.360
I've been living on the edge for years.

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:24.200
I'm not afraid of the police.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.080
Even if I die,

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:28.919
I'll take you two with me.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.320
It's worth it.

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:35.600
Let her go.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.720
I agree to all your demands.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.120
Let her go?

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:40.159
K,

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:43.120
I want you and her
to join Boss in the grave.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.080
I'm not K.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.200
You're mistaken.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.320
You aren't?

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.799
Go on, keep pretending.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.120
Qian, help!

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.159
Qian!

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.399
- Move.
- Qian!

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:01.960
Help!

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.399
Qian!

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.000
None of you
can get out of here alive today.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.159
And you!

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:11.000
We've done so much for the Wei family.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.360
Just because we are no longer useful,

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:17.000
you actually sent him
to get rid of us all.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:18.200
K,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.639
are you still going
to deny your identity?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.360
I don't know what you mean.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.360
Fine.

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:30.159
Then keep acting.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.279
Miss Wei,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.159
you probably don't know yet,

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:39.519
but your fiancé and this woman

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:43.000
were quite intimate in Tai City.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.440
He even risked his life

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:51.000
and jumped into the sea to save her.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:55.720
K,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.440
considering we were once brothers,

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:00.039
I'll give you a chance to save them.

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:03.240
I have another gun here.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.440
Let's see who you'll choose.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.159
Your fiancée,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.360
or your old lover?

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:12.799
Pick one to kill.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.000
Then I'll let the other go,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.120
and you can have a happily ever after.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.360
How about it?

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.159
If you don't choose,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.559
I'll just kill them both.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.360
Help!

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.000
Qian, help!

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720
Make your choice.
