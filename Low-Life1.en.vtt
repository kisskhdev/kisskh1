Where the hell is he?

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.928
Beats me. Three months ago,
he left and no one's heard a word since.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.179
What's this about?

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.640
He's wanted. He violated
the Political Purification Laws.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.433 line:20%
-What's that mean?
-That he's anti-government.

My brother?

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.107
Hey, you've got the wrong guy.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.067
He's not the type
to get himself involved--

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.444
Don't give me that,
you lying piece of shit.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:16.947
Hey. You think we're
fucking around here?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.200
No, no, no, no. I mean it.
Here. Just this once.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.536
If you let us off easy today,
when he gets here,

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.538
I'll grab him by the neck and drag him
to the station myself.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.831
You are gonna bring him in.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.958
- Got it?
- Yes, of course.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.377
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.586
Bye.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.172
Oh, thank you, sir.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:36.716
Have a good day, officers.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.637
How are you? You okay?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.556
Heedong, what about you?

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.435
Where could he have run off to?

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.438
I don't know.
He mentioned he was going south.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.564
South?

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.149
I can't believe those bastards.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.818
They smashed up our house!

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.283
Your dad… he'll be back soon, okay?

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.373
Here.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.125
Take it.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:13.879
Hey.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.840
Do you know what
the most important thing in the world is?

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.135
This right here.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.512
This is the reason your dad's on the run.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.307
Everything in the world moves
because of this.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.059
This is life itself. Remember that.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.023 line:20%

He taught me the true value of money
and what it can really do.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.031
We had to flee during the war…

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.367
Hang on a sec.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.662

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.957
Anyone home?

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:53.710
Excuse me?

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.716
Stay here and keep watch.
Cough if you see someone, got it?

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.554
I wasn't allowed to get involved at first,

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.599
then he started giving me
some smaller, safer roles.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.810
Just enough to participate
without the risk.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.406
What are you doing in front of my store?

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.700
- What?
- Come on, move.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.121
Uncle! Uncle!

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.374

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.132
Stop!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.763
Ow. What the fuck?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.268
Son of a bitch. Trying to die?

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:55.105
My uncle was never the type
to get easily intimidated.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.191
He would even stand up to gangsters
when they picked fights with him.

00:05:58.275 --> 00:05:59.818
What'd you say?

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.486
You're a stupid fuck.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.406
Do you even know who you're talking to?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.616
You can kiss my ass, for all I care.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.619
You really are dumb.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.414
You really wanna die, don't you?

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.624
We should call the police!

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.960
He wasn't really a good fighter, though.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.712
Fucking asshole.

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.547
Heedong.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:25.135
You sons of bitches. Come back!

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.261

PALSEONG LIQUOR

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:38.899
There's no way to find an opening
with all these trucks coming in.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:42.319
Shit, it'll be a pain
once they lock it up in storage.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.862
Then why wait? Let's do it.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.864
Not with them working right there.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.365
Hey!

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.700
This crazy little…

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.204
Ah, shit.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.516
You're crazy.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.605
There's some more in the truck.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:19.898
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.361
Huh?

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.240
|Who are you?

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.410
Oh, hi. Working the late shift, huh?

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.162
I'll leave you to it.

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.082
Go. Hey, hey. Go!

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.752
Go, go! Damn it.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.922
- Over here! Thieves! We got thieves!
- Uh… oh, shit.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.841
-Whoa, where are they?
-Hey!

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.468
Whoa! Whoa!

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.554
Damn it, you fuckers! Bring it on!
I'll crack your heads wide open.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.014
Run for it, Uncle!

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.684
- Put it down!
- Asshole!

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.063
Come on, then! You want more?
You want more?

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.941
You motherfuckers wanna go? Bastards.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.442
Calm down!

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.069
Yeah, that's right, assholes.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.157
Whoa! Get him!

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.157
Whoa! Get him!

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.461
How could you leave me
like that, you traitor?

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.297
Hey, one of us had to make it.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.509
- Come on, push!
- I am pushing, damn it!

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.803
So tired.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.807
When I was old enough,
we started out with petty theft,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.518
which eventually turned
into some pretty dangerous jobs.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.564
And yet, none of those jobs
made us any money.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.900
Quietly, you idiot, you'll wake the kids.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.319
- Yeah, I got it.
- Then do it right.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.781
You're not even helping.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:59.956
- Careful with that.
- I said I got it.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.751
-Lookie here.
-You scared me.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.503
-Catch you at a bad time?
-Who are you?

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.424
Is it over here?

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.928
Wow. Quite a haul you got.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.514
- Uh… who…
- Oh, me?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.559
I'm from Criminal Affairs.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.982
Wow, you wrote every last detail.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.486
Uncle was in school during
the war when he lost interest in studying.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.280
When he dropped out, he started
obsessively writing everything down

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:33.615
to keep sharp.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.284
But he kept his books so detailed

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:39.412
that they ended up becoming
the evidence of all his crimes.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.457
Hey, why did you steal soy sauce?

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.960
I really like marinated crab.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.673
I hope you'll go easy on us.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:54.636
I was hopping from prison
to prison with Uncle when I met him.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.763
A big shot in the antique business.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:58.640
-Hey.
-The Insa-dong Wildcat.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.184
You guys mind if I take a break
for just a little while?

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.603
Look at you.

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.147
Can't even do it for one minute,
you fucking geezer?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.774
Come here, asshole.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.443
Please. Please, just stop.
Please, I can't--

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:13.071
Stop being a bitch.
Head on the ground, now.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.073
Head on the ground, you piece of shit!

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.616
Shut the fuck up, you idiots!

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.077
I've had it up to here
with this shit, okay?

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.458
What was that?

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.921
Look, you crazy fuck.

00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:31.881
You sit there and mind your business.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:35.260
You want a piece of me?
You know who you're talking to?

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:41.808
Oh, shit.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.643
Anyone else?

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.401
So you go out
into the boonies and what do you find out?

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.154
All these folks are just sitting
on these priceless ceramics,

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.197
wasting away, using them as dog bowls.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.615
A good eye, that's how you know

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.450
- what they're really worth…
- Huh?

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.535
Mr. Song.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.079
Oh, look who it is! Gwanseok. Hey.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.998
-Oh, wow.
-What landed you in here this go around?

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.374
Oh, don't even go there.

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:09.419
I handed over a few ceramics to a guy,
and it all went sideways.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.671
- Oh, man.
- Hey, do you know each other?

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:12.922
Hmm?

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.633
He's the Insa-dong Wildcat.
I've told you about him.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.051
Oh.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.220
How do you know this kid?

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:20.889
My nephew.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.017
Ah, the rude little bastard who…

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:26.603
Wow.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.856
-You two make quite the pair.
-No, no, no, that's my other nephew.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.610
- Heedong.
- Ah…

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.778
I'm gonna be transferring
over to your cell.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.656
-Wait, how?
-I gave the guards some money.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.742
What'd I say?
There's nothing money can't buy.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.161
Where'd you get the dough?

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.663
In my cell, I run the books.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.502
Look at you. Your day is here.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:54.005
Don't wanna stick around
a little longer? Hmm?

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.257
Get in touch once you're out.
I got work for you.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.342
Hmm?

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.011
- Come on, let's go.
- Yes, yes.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:02.180
- I'll see you.
- Hang in there.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.349
Song was the first to get out,

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.893
-and then Uncle moved into my cell.
-How are y'all doing?

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.604
My uncle had a real knack
for making things happen.

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:12.315
Like if someone wanted to start
a business, he'd find them a spot,

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.318
help them get funding, find people
who wanna work, all that stuff.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.278
He was really good at that kind of thing.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.989
Hey, Song says
he's got a job lined up for us.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.659
-Doing what?
-I'll know once we're out.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.410
No thanks.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:25.787
Well then,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.873
the guy in the next room
has a little racket selling fake booze.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.001
He says we can get 50% of it.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.837
Except we need a truck
for that kind of work. We don't have one.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.174
We got the handcart, don't we?
You just gotta tough it out.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.677
No way. I ain't doing that.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.099
Fine, then.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.184
Find some rich old bat and seduce her.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.520
Where would I find her?

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:54.023
Look at you.
This great face you're packing.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.901
And speaking of packing,
that ain't nothing.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.861
Hey, forget it.

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.656
You're being too picky right now. Do it.

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:04.617
It's safe.
There's no risk.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.244
I said forget it.

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:07.996
Anyway, I have a girlfriend.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.540
You do?

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.375
I do.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.627
Soon as I'm out, we're getting hitched.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:17.046
You're nuts.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.257
I'm already engaged.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.592
-What?
-I met someone else.

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:25.638
Well, that didn't take long.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:30.101
You need to get your act together
and start settling down.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:31.602
Stop scamming others.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.233
Were any of the things you gave me
real to begin with?

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:42.113
I mean, is there anything
in your life that's real?

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:48.536
Take care.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.708
Shit.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.216 line:20%
Geez, way to go, bonehead.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.342 line:20%
INSA-DONG, SEOUL

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:05.470 line:20%
You tried your luck
with a college girl? Really?

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.264 line:20%
What's wrong with college girls?
Come on. Chicks are chicks.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:09.766
I don't know, man.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.976
Did you even understand
a word she was saying?

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.354
-We were hitting it off just fine.
-Your ass barely got through junior high.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.483
Educated women see it all, you know?

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.818
She could probably see
right through you, dummy.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:23.821
I said find work,
not go on dates and shit.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.656
You gotta show some love to get it.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:30.036
You're supposed to fake it, not be
the one who actually falls first, yeah?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.205
Come here. When you're in deep,

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.290
you're supposed to
keep your emotions in check.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.667
Whatever. It's just what happens
when I get close.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.419
You idiot.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.630
A smart girl like that
is too good for you.

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.507
Know your worth before diving in.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.925
What'd you think would happen?

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:47.053
What? Were you expecting her
to roll over and give you some money?

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.057
I don't have trouble getting chicks,
but then I just…

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.141
ORIENTAL ART GALLERY

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.309
-Here it is.
-Yeah.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.062
Oh, brother.
Let's see who his mark is now.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.523
This price is just for you.
Otherwise it'd be over a million.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.319
So, when did you get out then?

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.321
- A little while ago.
- Mmm.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.740
It reeks in here.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.325
What is this, a flea market?

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.870
Hey, this place is one of the top three
antique stores in the country.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.124
Dream on. This garbage?

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.250
Ah…

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.670
The real stuff's all inside. I'll show ya.

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.005
All right.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.175
Right in here.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.387
Have a seat, yeah.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.015
Well, this is more like it.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.565
Have a seat, I said.
I'll get you some coffee.

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.155
- Okay.
- How much do you think that is?

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.407
I don't know. Like, 50 won?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.033
That's inlaid celadon.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:52.827
30,000 won.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.706
Wait, celadon's, like,
a national treasure, right?

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.041
Nah, it's not all that rare, actually.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.210
That's why it's only worth 30,000 won.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.005
- Really? This is worth that much?
- Hey, hey, hey! D…

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:06.382
Don't do that.
Just put it down and settle.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.925
Come on. Come on, sit.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:11.762
Mmm.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.020
Hot.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.272
So what are you working on these days?

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.150
Keeping busy. I've got a full plate.

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.986
You just got out of prison.
How busy can you be?

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.071
You said you had work.

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:33.367
These folks over in Jeolla, Sinan coast,

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.870
they caught a few pieces of pottery
in their nets.

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:37.496
They could be worth something.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.789
What are you asking?

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.250
I want you to go and get them for me.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.252
You want me to deliver pottery?

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.046
That's not all you're doing.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.215
These pieces are buried underwater,

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.550
which means you'll have to fish them
out of the sea.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.844
And I'll pay you up front,
so don't worry about that.

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:53.804
Why me, though? I'm no sailor.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.308
Well, you're a fellow
who gets things done around here.

00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:00.519
It sound like a lot of hassle.
How valuable are these?

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.356
The place is probably a complete mudflat.

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.483
Valuable, my foot.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.362
Look, this is just what I do.
Just trying to develop a collection.

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.030
Well, what's it pay, then?

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.991
400,000.

00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.619
F-F-Four hundred thousand won?

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:20.039
You know, that's about
half a year's salary for a civil servant.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.791
Just bring them to me intact, okay?

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.461
These pieces have been underwater
for so long, they're likely fragile now.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.046
Handle with care, huh?

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.436
Let's eat some grub at my place.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.063
I'm good. I'm not hungry.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.066
We gotta talk about the job, kid.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.610
What do you mean?
There's nothing to talk about.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.153
We get 400,000.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.655
Shut up and follow me.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:02.415
I dreaded going to my uncle's.
He was a pain in the ass.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.298
He had a son in seventh grade
and a daughter with tuberculosis.

00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.675
He'd always give them
a long lecture before dinner.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.802
What's this?

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:19.140
You think I swam all the way
across the Han River during the war

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.684
just to see grades like these? Hmm?

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:22.935
What'd I say?

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.855
You have to be indispensable.

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:30.276
Like a screw that got jammed deep in there
and won't come out, no matter what.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.903
But the worst part was
that he'd take all the time in the world

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.238
just to go over his day.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.324
Hey, did she take her meds?

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:38.618
Uncle had to jot down everything
that happened throughout the day

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.244
before he could feel relaxed.

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:43.539
Hey, weren't we gonna talk?

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.750
In a minute.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.257
Then, he'd spend time
going through his son's bag

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:56.594
to make sure he had everything ready
to go for school the next day.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.806
And he'd never forget
to slip in a bar of chocolate.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:03.934
Hey, get us something to eat.

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:05.061
Right now?

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:08.189
-But we don't have anything--
-Oh, no. Don't worry, Auntie.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:09.815
It's the middle of the night.

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.400
I think this right here

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.737
is the last drink
we're going to have for a while.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:19.867
I have a feeling
that this job Song got for us…

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.452
It's not gonna be easy.

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:23.412
Why?

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:27.083
Well, he's asking us to go fishing, right?

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.542
Me, of all people.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.628
Why do you think that is?

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.340
He trying to avoid using pros.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.592
And why would he avoid bringing them on?

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.887
-'Cause word will get out.
-And then what happens?

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.013
Less profit.

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.057
Just profit?

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.436
The real issue is, it's pottery.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.440
There are probably others who are
going after it too.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.275
So, there's danger.

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:54.902
Yeah.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:58.656
This whole job is looking like
it's going to be a real pain in the ass.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:00.616
Hmm.

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:02.743
But how do you figure?

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.162
We just gotta fish them out
and hand them over, right?

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.251
Like I'm gonna go all the way down there
to make a measly 400,000.

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.420
What do you take me for?

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:16.090
Hey.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:19.885
Look, about how many pieces are there
in the sea?

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.097
-We don't know.
-Then tell me, who would know?

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.057
Nobody would.

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:26.684
Right, no one knows.

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:29.311
Get what I'm saying?

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:32.898
Oh.

00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:36.694
- We take some.
- Yeah, that's it!

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:38.946
Right.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.660
So stay off the drinks for now, okay?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:49.457
-Go to Mokpo and hear what they're saying.
-Mokpo and what? Why? Who's there?

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.834
My third cousin's daughter lives
over there.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.296
Third cousin?
You're practically strangers.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.758 line:20%
MOKPO

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.953
The owner? She should be here soon.

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:30.581
Go inside and have a cup of tea
while you wait.

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.333
You the third cousin's kid?

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.627
Third cousin?
Don't that make us strangers?

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.961
Exactly.

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.632
Hey, do y'all like coffee in Seoul?

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.967
Yeah, right? Ours is real nice.

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.052
I'm good.

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.348
Here she comes. That's the owner.

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:50.434
It's gonna take forever
to teach you

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:51.936
how to make any money at this rate.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:55.314
Ms. Jang, you got a guest.
Came here all the way from Seoul.

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:56.941
Oh, yeah.

00:21:57.024 --> 00:22:00.694
Hmm, I wasn't expecting
such a pretty boy, at that.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:04.490
I suppose you're looking
for a captain with a boat, huh?

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:07.910
- Yeah.
- A captain… Well, let's see.

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.120
Will the old man be at his home yet?

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:12.540
-Well, where does he live?
-You kidding?

00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:13.666
If I was a psychic,

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:16.210
why would I be running this joint?

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.754
- Where does he usually hang around, then?
- Where do you think?

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:22.091
I mean, it's likely he's eaten now,
being suppertime and whatnot.

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:25.469
-Kambap is one of his favorite meals.
-Okay, so how do I find him already?

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:28.472
Well, he likes to come by
my place just about every day,

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:30.641
so you can stick around,
if you buy something.

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.561
You want me to just wait
for who knows how long?

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:37.273
Just hold your horses.
He'll show up after dark.

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:40.985
Are people so rude in Seoul, they don't
buy something if they ask for directions?

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.319
Gratitude gets you far.

00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:44.822
I'm introducing you to a captain,
aren't I?

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:47.199
So come in and buy a drink.

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:48.701
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:07.469
Sometimes, you come
across things that seem so out of place.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.060
Mmm.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.522
The coffee's pretty good.

00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:30.159
Where's the captain?

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:34.788
Madam Jang, guess who's here.

00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:37.249
- Oh, you're here.
- I'm here too.

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.335
Got quite a crowd today,
don't we?

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:41.629
Geez,
where'd you wet your beaks?

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:43.297
You two are drunk as skunks.

00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:46.884
Drunk? Who's drunk?
We had some makgeolli.

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:50.304
-Just one glass each with our meal.
-Just a glass, my ass.

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:51.764
More like you shared a barrel.

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:54.683
Anyway, heard someone's looking
for us, huh?

00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:04.234
I ask for one captain,
and now the whole town knows.

00:24:04.318 --> 00:24:07.363
Who could have any idea
if they're fake or real?

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:09.531
Well, uh, even so.

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:12.576
When we catch things like that
in our nets, we don't like it at all.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.870
It's real bad luck, don't you know?

00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:16.956
You know, apparently,
someone caught a few pieces,

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:19.625
took 'em to Gwangju.
Even made a pretty sum of it.

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.794
Once that happened, that was it.

00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.712
His eyes were never the same after that.

00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:25.130
That's not how it went, okay?

00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:27.424
Look, Choi went out there,
set out his nets,

00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:29.051
caught what he thought was trash,

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.595
but his younger brother,
he reckoned it's Goryeo ware,

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:33.138
and took it to the county office.

00:24:33.222 --> 00:24:35.224
But the person there laughed in his face.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.601
"Goryeo ware in this small town?"

00:24:37.685 --> 00:24:39.311
"You must be outta your damn gourd."

00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:40.688
Then word started getting out

00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:42.773
and someone came by and said,
"Here, show me,"

00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:44.483
and what do you know, they was real.

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:48.112
And now, that's exactly
how it all went down.

00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:50.489
Dang, look at you.

00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:53.409
We got ourselves a storyteller here,
don't we?

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:56.161
- You talkin' shit now?
- What?

00:24:56.245 --> 00:24:59.581
The hell? What the hell's your problem?
I ain't talkin' shit.

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.001
Hey, you need to learn
to watch your mouth.

00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:04.294
I'll choke you in a fucking net,
you little--

00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:06.463
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What?

00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:09.008
So you're saying
they're already gone then, right?

00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:11.301
Mind your manners, young man.

00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:13.721
Hey, don't you read the news?

00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:16.348
The government,
they already finished investigating.

00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:17.808
Even the president was there.

00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:19.893
Took a picture
with the pottery and everything.

00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:21.437
That's not all of it.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.481
The currents are strong over there,
so they only wound up with a few.

00:25:24.565 --> 00:25:26.692
Even the government gave up after a while.

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.153
There's still gotta be a ton left
in the mudflat.

00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:32.281
Did you see them with your damn eyes?
Then how come you ain't digging there?

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.199
Shut the hell up.

00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:36.076
Hey, wait a minute.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.078
So here's the thing…

00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:40.122
Digging 'em up ain't gonna be
easy or free.

00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:42.499
How are you gonna pay for it?

00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:45.002
Just quit fighting.
Giving me a headache.

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:48.005
Who the hell
does he think he is? Little punk.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.968
So word already got out.

00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:55.054
The government came to dig out
what they could.

00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:57.389
So, what?
Should we bail on it, then?

00:25:57.473 --> 00:25:58.891
No, not exactly.

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.809
They just didn't bother keeping it quiet

00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:03.645
'cause they don't think
it's worth the time and effort.

00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:05.647
They don't see it as a gold mine.

00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:06.899
Well, that's good to hear.

00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:09.860
Although,
Song's not completely sure either.

00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:12.488
Yeah, that's the reason
why I'm still debating this.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:13.864
That doesn't mean we shouldn't do it.

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:15.449
Let's say we dig around.

00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:17.993
I think we can make 200,000. Let's do it.

00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:19.620
Why are you suddenly so into this?

00:26:21.663 --> 00:26:23.874
It's just…
…the coffee's pretty good here.

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.336
You're the first to praise Mokpo
for the coffee instead of the seafood.

00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:29.338
Just saying.

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:30.547
Anyway,

00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:33.342
we need to get as much cash
out of Song as we can.

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:36.512
- So finish up and hurry back.
- All right.

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.013
What?

00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:40.224
Hey, I-I need to call you back later.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.893
Hey, how long you been standing there?

00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:45.145
What's got you so stirred
like you're guilty of somethin'?

00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:49.066
-Why the hell were you listening in, huh?
-What's there to even listen in on, huh?

00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:53.987
-If you've got time, treat me to some hoe.
-Why should I?

00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.532
Is everybody from Seoul
as cranky as you are?

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.117
Forget it. Your loss.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.203
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Fine. I-I'll get you some.

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:02.913
All right?

00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.332
What do you got for me though, then?

00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:08.001
You won't be wasting your money,
that's for sure.

00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:09.962
Well, what's that mean?

00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.674
The guys you talked to earlier,

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.510
the three of them want me
to keep an eye on you.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:18.887
See who you're meetin'
and what you're talkin' about.

00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:20.764
Gave me a thousand for the trouble.

00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:22.724
-Why would they do that?
-Obvious, isn't it?

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:23.809
'Cause the pottery.

00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:26.895
Looks like grave robbing's back in season.

00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:29.022
Least, that's what
the rumor mill's sayin'.

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.316
How's that?

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.318
That should be worth the price of hoe.

00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:37.406
Hey, Seonja.

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.866
What're you up to there, huh?

00:27:38.949 --> 00:27:42.619
Dang. Look at you,
off foolin' around with some guy, hmm?

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:47.499
- Who's he?
- He ain't no one.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.586
Yeah? So you were flirtin'
with no one then?

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.129
Shakin' your lil tail?

00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:55.132 line:20%
BEOLGU

00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:57.467
-He's ain't from here.
-Flirtin'? Flirtin', my foot.

00:27:57.551 --> 00:27:58.886
Just get walkin'.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:01.889
Now why would I go and do that
when I came here for you?

00:28:01.972 --> 00:28:03.181
Hey.

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:04.308 line:20%
PILMAN

00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:05.475 line:20%
Where are you from?

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.521 line:20%
-Ignore them. Just go.
-Hey, you're not goin' nowhere.

00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:10.606 line:20%
DOHUN

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.441 line:20%
'Cause the boss ain't done talkin'!

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:14.526
What's going on?

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:18.196
Nah, nothin'.
There's nothing going on.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.740
"Nothing," that right?

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:22.910
You rotten pricks
are pickin' a fight with my customer.

00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:24.703
Go on, then. Get.

00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:27.372
Hey, now.
We're not pickin' no fight.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.625
We're just sayin' hi.

00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:32.628
And what are you doin' out here?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.637
Hey, word of advice.

00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:44.640
Keep your hands off my girl, outsider.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:48.268
- You could wind up dead.
- Hey, hey, Boss.

00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:49.853
Let's get some coffee then, yeah?

00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:51.271
Let's go.

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:55.400
- Ah, man. What a bitch.
- Come on. Let's go.

00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:56.610
Pussy.

00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:57.819
Ignore them, 'kay?

00:28:58.862 --> 00:29:00.322
They're just a bunch of idiots.

00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:08.914
These motherfuckers.

00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:12.751
Now where could
he have run off to?

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:14.795
He left the store alone.

00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:15.921
Is that Han?

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.353
Oh, Mr. Han.

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:34.982
- Oh!
- How are you?

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:36.984
- Gwanseok.
- Hi. What's goin' on?

00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:38.068 line:20%
MR. HAN

00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:40.654 line:20%
-You don't know where Song is, do ya?
-He's not here?

00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:43.240
Oh, shoot. I'm here to see him too.

00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:44.324
Oh, really?

00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:46.535
Oh, well.

00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:49.997
I'll see you…
…uh, next time then.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.249
All right, take care. Bye.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:56.294
Now, where the hell
did you go now?

00:30:08.432 --> 00:30:10.809
ARE YOU MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN
CHEON TOMORROW MORNING?

00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:12.269
"Chairman Cheon."

00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:15.397
Cheon, huh?

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.487 line:20%
HEAD OFFICE
OF HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:26.575
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.046
- You can keep the change.
- Thank you.

00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:03.111
Sixth floor.

00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:05.906
HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:10.410
Twelfth floor.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.179
Gas prices went up by 4.275%.

00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:31.973
Wow, it went that high?

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:34.392
Mm-hmm.

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:39.773
"214.5 won per liter,
and 251 won for premium."

00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:43.902
Hmm. I think we might have to cut down.

00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:47.155
Right.

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:48.865
In July, they're rising again.

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:52.202
-Better to stock up sooner.
-Ma'am.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.878
-Ms. Yang, hello.
-Hi.

00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:05.382
- Is the chairman inside?
- Yes. He's in his office.

00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:06.466
Mr. Kang.

00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:10.178
Oh, thank you.

00:32:16.226 --> 00:32:18.145
I hear your mother's coming to visit.

00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:21.356
- Oh, she is?
- What, she didn't tell you?

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:23.275
I hadn't heard.

00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:25.986
It's spring now.
Take her to see some flowers.

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:27.070
Right.

00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:33.660
Oh, hold on!

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:36.454
-Hello, Director Lee.
-Hello, Mrs. Yang.

00:32:36.538 --> 00:32:38.456
Are you here to see the chairman?

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.542
- Yes. How are you?
- Good, thank you.

00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:43.336
How are the apartments in Yeouido?

00:32:43.837 --> 00:32:46.047
Good. They'll be finished within the year.

00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.966
Land prices there are getting high,

00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:49.718
and I hear a park is in the works.

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.262
That area is going to see
massive development.

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:55.932
-Good to see you.
-You too.

00:32:56.016 --> 00:32:57.017
We should have lunch.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.476
Love to.

00:33:16.036 --> 00:33:18.163
Hello, Mrs. Yang.

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:21.124
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Yang.
- Hello, Mrs. Yang.

00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:23.627
-Have you been waiting long?
-No, not at all. I just arrived.

00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:25.962
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:29.966
- I'm here.
- Oh, hi.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.394 line:20%
Hello, Chairman Cheon.

00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:42.854 line:20%
CHAIRMAN CHEON HWANGSIK

00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:44.564 line:20%
Oh. Sit down.

00:33:45.482 --> 00:33:46.483 line:20%
Okay.

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.402
- No, no. Do it this way.
- Mmm.

00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:50.487
Here. Here.

00:34:07.754 --> 00:34:08.755
Mr. Song.

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:12.467
What…

00:34:13.093 --> 00:34:15.679
-Gwanseok, what are you doing here?
-Wow.

00:34:15.762 --> 00:34:19.182
All these years of us being friends
meant nothing to you, did they?

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:21.268
What are you talking about?

00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:24.104
The Sinan pottery.
What are they really worth?

00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:28.316
Uh, how can I tell you for certain
without taking a good look at them first?

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.151
Come on, I know that's bullshit.

00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:33.071
Word's already out.

00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:35.073
400,000's chump change.

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:36.783
-Who the hell d'you think you're trying…
-Hey.

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:39.202
-…to take for a ride here?
-Shh! You should keep your voice down.

00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:40.829
Get your hands off!

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:43.415
Look, listen. Let's go somewhere
and talk this out.

00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:44.499
What's there to say?

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.751
- Just come on. Hey!
- Hey, let go!

00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:50.422
Look, regardless of the situation,
it's not like I'm not using you for free.

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:52.924
Using me?
What am I to you, a tool?

00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:54.551
Oh, please. Calm down.

00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:58.054
Honestly, I don't know what
the ceramics are gonna be worth.

00:34:58.138 --> 00:35:00.932
I'm taking a gamble here,
so it's not fair for you to accuse me.

00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:03.518
How are you gonna sell them
to Chairman Cheon then?

00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:06.313
- That's your plan, isn't it?
- Hey…

00:35:06.396 --> 00:35:08.231
You already know about everything.

00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:09.691
Mr. Song.

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:11.276
Just spill it.

00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:14.654
After all the drinks
we've had over the years,

00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:17.657
do you wanna burn the bridge
between us like this?

00:35:17.741 --> 00:35:19.034
Fine. You're right.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.998
The truth is, whether the pottery
is real or fake doesn't matter one bit.

00:35:25.081 --> 00:35:26.833
Chairman Cheon's agreed to buy them all.

00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:30.128
I've even laid the groundwork. I've
already sold him a few genuine pieces.

00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:32.422
I've been working on this
for six months now.

00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:33.923
About how many are you selling?

00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:36.343
Don't know how many there are,
so whatever we can get.

00:35:36.426 --> 00:35:38.053
What if we don't find that many?

00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:40.722
I already have a plan for that.

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:41.890
What is it?

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.808
Welcome.

00:35:44.601 --> 00:35:46.811
-Hey. This one good?
-Oh, here. Please take a seat.

00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:49.105
- What would you like?
- Let's have jjajangmyeon.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.193
When I first heard
about the pottery in Sinan,

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.780
I planted some seedlings.

00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:59.658
I'm getting 300 pieces ready
at a fish farm.

00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:01.618
Six months
and few hundred barnacles later,

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:05.080
they could easily pass
for 200 or 300 years old.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.042
So even if you come up short,
there's that?

00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:10.251
Exactly.

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:13.463
So either way, there's always gonna
be enough to sell there.

00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:18.968
Why not just sell those then?
You're scamming the man anyway.

00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:20.136
Hey, now.

00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:24.307
When you're scamming, what's the most
important thing you have to do, hmm?

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:26.643
You have to be sincere with them.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.730
You gotta be able to look at them and say,

00:36:30.814 --> 00:36:33.191
"This pottery's really from Sinan,
you know."

00:36:33.983 --> 00:36:36.069
And you've gotta say it
straight from the heart.

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:40.657
Sure. You're not gonna feel guilty
about selling the fake ones?

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.908
That's easy.

00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:44.577
I'll have the fake ones
and the real ones in one container.

00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:46.037
Out of sight, out of mind, you see?

00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:50.583
And you'll only put
the real ones on display then?

00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:52.168
Exactly.

00:36:52.669 --> 00:36:55.880
Look here, when two people
sit down and gab face-to-face,

00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:58.299
it's easy to tell
when they're trying to bullshit you.

00:36:59.008 --> 00:37:00.677
Does it look like I'm lying right now?

00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:05.473
Wow.

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:08.268
Please enjoy.

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:12.021
It's all 'cause I'm being sincere.

00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:19.279
All right then.

00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:21.823
Let's up the ante.

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:26.035
-What do you mean?
-I might have looked into it.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.248
This could be big.
Whoever finds it gets to claim it.

00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:33.960
Hey, you… Were you working
on this behind my back?

00:37:34.043 --> 00:37:36.629
I'm ain't doin' this for a measly 400,000.

00:37:36.713 --> 00:37:39.632
-I say we do this right, find some hands.
-Huh?

00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:42.761
You can go small
if you wanna keep it for yourself,

00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:44.971
or we can go for the big money together.

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.109
That's one million.

00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:00.069
It'll be enough to get a boat,
hire some divers.

00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.614
And that should cover travel as well.

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:07.160
And, uh, take this guy along.

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.244
He works for me.

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.371
He's a good kid. Mmm.

00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:12.040
Mr. Song,

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.751
are you planting eyes on us?

00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:18.004
Hey, if we're working together,
we gotta stay in close contact, don't we?

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.051
You were saying that you're 28,
am I right?

00:38:23.802 --> 00:38:24.803
Yeah.

00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:27.263
Well, Daesik, here…

00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:29.974
uh, w-what are you, 30?

00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:32.894
I'm 28.

00:38:36.189 --> 00:38:38.733
He's, um, a good kid. Mmm.

00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:41.778
You two are the same age.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.363
You should get along, you two.

00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:48.034
I'm Na Daesik.
Let's try and get along.

00:38:51.287 --> 00:38:52.580
Ah.

00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:56.334
Just so you know, this guy right here,
he knows how to throw a punch.

00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:57.460
He competed in

00:38:57.544 --> 00:38:59.295
the Jecheon County
Amateur Boxing Tournament.

00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:01.673
I don't know what it is exactly,

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:04.509
but the look in his eyes
really gets under my skin.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.012
That's not how you should
look at your boss, is it?

00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:12.809
Oh, what the hell?

00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:14.310
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:17.856
Hey, I'm Oh Heedong, and I'm above you.

00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:19.691
Ow.

00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:21.442
Why do you both have to be like this?

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:23.111
Oh, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.280
I-I just need to rest
for one second, okay?

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.865
-Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-So…

00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:28.449
…that guy, Cheon.

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:29.576
He has a thing for pottery?

00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.414
It's not the pottery he's after.

00:39:38.668 --> 00:39:41.504
His family moved here from
North Korea after independence,

00:39:41.588 --> 00:39:43.965
but soon, they realized
things were no better in Seoul.

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:47.510
The whole family took on
whatever work they could do to get by,

00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:51.014
and during the war, they made
decent money selling American goods.

00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:53.057
Cheon couldn't write,

00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.976
but spoke English with the best of them.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:58.479
He started an import business
after befriending American soldiers.

00:39:59.188 --> 00:40:02.525
And then some time after that,
he inherited his father's business.

00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:05.528
That was Heungbaek Plastics,
which became the Heungbaek Corporation.

00:40:06.195 --> 00:40:07.822
And it really took off, you know,

00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:09.991
'cause everyone and their mother
needed plastic.

00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:13.244
But as the business grew
and he hired more hands,

00:40:13.328 --> 00:40:15.413
that's when a new issue reared its head.

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:17.081
What issue?

00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:18.541
Well, he's the head of the company,

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:20.919
but every employee he hired
had way more education.

00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:24.047
And what do you know, he couldn't
understand anything that they would say.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.009
So what? Does he wanna
re-enroll in school or something?

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:30.011
Well, when his first wife died,
he remarried.

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.472
And his new wife,
her suggestion was to open a college.

00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:35.850
Uh-huh, 'cause that was when there
was a whole thing with enrollment issues.

00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:37.727
With enrollments?

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.020
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:42.023
Basically, the state said schools
could only accept ten students.

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.233
And wouldn't you know,
some chose to ignore that.

00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:46.069
Then when the government pointed it out,

00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:48.237
the schools said,
"Just let the students stay."

00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:52.033
It was then Cheon's new wife saw this
as an opportunity to make quick cash

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.327
and badgered him into
starting a school right away.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.245
With tuition fees and state funding,

00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:58.623
can you imagine how much money
they can make?

00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:00.750
Well, now,
there's a racket.

00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:04.379
So Cheon started putting together
his college, but he needed something else.

00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:06.297
"What about an antiques museum?"

00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:07.966
That's why he needs antiques.

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:09.676
That's the interest in pottery, huh?

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:10.760
Exactly.

00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:13.972
How impressive would he look
to have a huge museum right in his school?

00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:16.391
Wow.

00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:20.311
Well, after hearing all that, seems like
we got ourselves a good target here.

00:41:20.395 --> 00:41:23.398
That aside,
the big challenge isn't Cheon,

00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:24.816
it's that wife of his, really.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.901
She's no ordinary lady.

00:41:26.985 --> 00:41:28.778
For 132 workers,

00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:30.613
that comes out to 264,000 won.

00:41:30.697 --> 00:41:32.615
She graduated from
a commercial high school

00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:34.784
and joined Heungbaek Plastics
as a bookkeeper.

00:41:35.702 --> 00:41:38.121
And it was her innate sharpness
that caught Cheon's eye.

00:41:38.204 --> 00:41:40.373
ESTIMATE - CHEONGSU
GENERAL HARDWARE AND SUPPLIES

00:41:41.708 --> 00:41:42.959
Those numbers are off.

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:45.962
It should be 5,618,245.

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:49.382
Well, you see, we report lower numbers
for subcontractors each quarter,

00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:51.426
then make up the difference
in the following one.

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:52.552
What's the reason for this?

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:55.179
That's just how we've always done it.

00:41:55.263 --> 00:41:57.432
Then where are
the records of those differences?

00:41:58.016 --> 00:42:00.852
Oh, that's…

00:42:01.811 --> 00:42:03.730 line:20%
It's fine. You can go.

00:42:04.814 --> 00:42:06.190
Yes, sir.

00:42:13.072 --> 00:42:14.407
Don't tell me.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.658
You took that money?

00:42:15.742 --> 00:42:19.662
Well, you need some slush funds, right?
If you're running a company, that is.

00:42:20.163 --> 00:42:22.957
You're awfully good
at sneaking around.

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:25.668
Just focus on
getting the college running, okay?

00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:29.589
When will I get approval
from the Ministry?

00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:31.215
Well, I wish I knew.

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:33.634
They're just dragging
their feet at this point.

00:42:34.135 --> 00:42:36.137
Sounds soon, though,
from the way they talk.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.556
Well, I think a dinner
would go a long way.

00:42:39.182 --> 00:42:41.809
Just sending some money
doesn't seem very sincere, does it?

00:42:41.893 --> 00:42:44.771
Just be patient
a little longer.

00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:47.607
We need to make ourselves
look good first, don't we?

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.900
You're talking about the museum.

00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:51.444
If money's all we got,
they'll never approve.

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:54.113
It'll all go straight to pot,
and we can forget it.

00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:56.532
All right.
Just let me be involved in this as well.

00:42:57.408 --> 00:43:00.244
It costs a fortune to build a museum.

00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:03.372
And we're not going to see any return,
so we should budget accordingly.

00:43:04.624 --> 00:43:08.795
ORIENTAL ART GALLERY

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:13.466
That Daesik guy rubs me the wrong way.

00:43:14.634 --> 00:43:16.969
I bet he and Song go way back, you know?

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.556
Guess Song's still holding things
close to his chest.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.017
You know better than to trust that guy.

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:24.644
What do you think?

00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:26.562
-About what?
-This job.

00:43:26.646 --> 00:43:28.064
You've got a good instincts.

00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:37.115
Wow, take a look at this.

00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:39.617
All of these were found in Sinan.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.578 line:20%
They're displaying them
at a new museum in Gwangju.

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:45.331 line:20%
The groundbreaking ceremony
is taking place

00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:47.959
over in Maegok-dong, Gwangju, it says.

00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:50.545
They've dug up
a thousand pieces already?

00:43:51.087 --> 00:43:53.506
-Do you think there are any left?
-Are a thousand pieces

00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:54.966
really that exciting?

00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:57.009
Come to my factory then.

00:43:57.093 --> 00:43:59.011
We've got thousands of stoves.

00:44:00.346 --> 00:44:03.057
See, with stoves,
the prices are fixed, aren't they?

00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:05.268
With pottery, the sky's the limit.

00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:08.646
So don't forget to take me along
when you go to buy them.

00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:10.815
I can spot a fraud from a mile away.

00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:14.777
How do you know
if someone's a fraud?

00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:17.071
It's all in the scent.
They smell fishy.

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:21.159
Did your ex-husband
sell a lot of fish or something?

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.162
Not exactly, but you aren't far off.

00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:26.831
He had a fishing vessel.
He would use it for cons.

00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:31.043
This has to be the one that sank
in the Indian Ocean I bet, right?

00:44:31.127 --> 00:44:32.378
I'm surprised you knew.

00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:34.255
Well, of course I knew.

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:39.010
If he was able to scam you,
he's no ordinary grifter, is he?

00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:42.263
I didn't get conned. He did.

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.347
What?

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:45.349
Oh, it's nothing.

00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:48.060
Why are you asking
so many questions though?

00:44:48.144 --> 00:44:50.897
- What are you jealous about?
- Jealous?

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.231
That's ridiculous.

00:44:52.815 --> 00:44:55.943
Anyway, didn't you say they
were heading down today to Mokpo?

00:44:56.027 --> 00:44:58.279
- Is that today? It's Thursday?
- Yes.

00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:02.158
I think you should show your face there.
It's good for morale if nothing else.

00:45:02.241 --> 00:45:04.869
Is that really necessary?

00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:08.247
People even steal rice
from Buddha. Keeping a close eye is needed

00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:10.249
with all that pottery there.
It's too tempting.

00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:14.045
You have a point.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.215
Where's Jeonchul, by the way?

00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:19.967
Why do you wanna know?

00:45:24.263 --> 00:45:26.807 line:20%
SEOUL STATION

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:30.686
The train to Mokpo
will be departing shortly.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.105
- Thank you.
- Next, please.

00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:34.690
1 EXPRESS, PUNGNYEON
2 EXPRESS, JEUNGSAN

00:45:34.774 --> 00:45:37.235
- Hi, can I get three tickets?
- Three for Mokpo?

00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:46.077
Be careful with your gout.

00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:48.120
No drinking. Not a drop. Got it?

00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:50.122
Yes, sir.

00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:53.376
Since you're working together,
try and get along, huh?

00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:55.753
Can you stop poking his eyes?

00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:57.964
Let's do our best.

00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:00.800
Oh, come on, don't--

00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:03.010
- We're off.
- Wait… hold on a second.

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:05.096
-Cheon is on his way here.
-He is? Why?

00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:07.306
He said he wanted to meet you
before you go.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:11.477
- Why the hell would he wanna do that?
- Once you get to Mokpo, here,

00:46:11.978 --> 00:46:13.771
one of my friends is staying at this inn.

00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.314
PEACE INN

00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:18.192
He's from Gwangju.
He'll help you with the appraisal, okay?

00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:21.070
Be sure to call every day now.

00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:22.655
This is getting uncomfortable.

00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:25.241
Look sharp. There he is.

00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:32.832
Chairman Cheon, glad you could make it.

00:46:32.915 --> 00:46:35.626
Well,
I heard your men were leaving today.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.171
-I'm just here to wish them good luck.
-Oh, you didn't have to do all that, sir.

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:42.967
Oh, this here…
This is the man who's in charge.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.428
- Oh. Hmm.
- I'm Oh Gwanseok.

00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:47.763
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:46:47.847 --> 00:46:49.557
We've already met, haven't we?

00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:56.105
Ah.

00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:58.107
Uh, right.

00:46:58.733 --> 00:47:00.901
And, uh, these are his assistants.

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:02.153
Say hello.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:03.821
Hello, sir!

00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:09.535
I also have someone to introduce.

00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:11.996
You'll be working together.
This is Mr. Im.

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.583
- Im Jeonchul, hey.
- Huh?

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.626
He's tagging along with us?

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:19.712
- Yes.
- Mrs. Yang,

00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:23.132
you were really that worried about us?
Uh, we already have a full team, yeah?

00:47:23.215 --> 00:47:26.969
Well, he's a pottery expert, you see.
So I'm sure he'll be helpful on this trip.

00:47:27.053 --> 00:47:28.679
Oh, I see.

00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:32.391
Uh, can we, uh,
talk for a minute?

00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:33.684
Y-Yes, of course, sir.

00:47:40.441 --> 00:47:42.443
So what is it that you do?

00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:44.320
I do pottery.

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:47.365
Yeah,
so what does that mean exactly?

00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:51.285
I'm getting a little offended here.

00:47:51.369 --> 00:47:52.870
I just do what I do, all right?

00:47:52.953 --> 00:47:54.705
Anything else, none of your business.

00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:56.290
I know I said he was an expert.

00:47:56.374 --> 00:48:00.211
In reality, he's just going on our behalf,
so he won't get in the way.

00:48:00.294 --> 00:48:01.545
Just try to get along.

00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:04.715
Great, now there's two guys, here,
who "won't get in the way," huh?

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.929
-How old are you?
-39, Year of the Rabbit.

00:48:10.012 --> 00:48:12.098
Okay, I'm a lot older.

00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:14.975
And you two, he's older,
so act accordingly.

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.145
Right. Uh, it's nice to meet you.

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:19.772
I'm Na Daesik, sir.

00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:23.234
You too.

00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:26.654
Nice to meet you.

00:48:32.368 --> 00:48:34.578
And how do you know each other?

00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:38.624
-Oh, this, here, is my nephew.
-What's your name?

00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:42.795
Hey, she asked you a question.

00:48:45.047 --> 00:48:46.715
You little shit.

00:48:46.799 --> 00:48:47.925
No, it's fine.

00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:49.844
Just do what they say.

00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:53.556
- Whatever job they ask you of you.
- Ma'am.

00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:56.725
His name is Oh Heedong, ma'am.

00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:58.727
Hey, go get another ticket.

00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:02.648
Move it, kid.

00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:04.942
Go. Go.

00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:07.445
Hi there.

00:49:08.988 --> 00:49:12.450
-Hey, Gwanseok, let's talk for a second.
-Hey, what's with all the secrets, huh?

00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:14.034
-Hurry. Over here.
-What is it?

00:49:16.245 --> 00:49:18.581
Once you get there,
there's another job to do.

00:49:21.167 --> 00:49:22.168
What? What is it?

00:49:24.211 --> 00:49:25.254
One for Mokpo.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.310
These seats are empty.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.072
- Oh, uh…
- Grab a seat anywhere.

00:49:58.245 --> 00:49:59.330
Go read somewhere else.

00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:02.500
- What was that?
- Move.

00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:03.709
What are you doing?

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:05.336
What do you mean?

00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:07.463
Hey, man.

00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:13.219
The book you threw…
It just nearly hit me in the eye.

00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:15.596
Hey, asshole.
Where's your fuckin' apology?

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.014
Just gonna stare all day?

00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:19.517
Just apologize. Don't make a scene.

00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:21.060
What was that?

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.606
-Apologize.
-Hey, sit down.

00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:28.817
Sit your ass down.

00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:30.319
He said to sit.

00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:32.571
- You fucking…
- Hey.

00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:34.323
Fucking son of a bitch.

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.492
I'm still waiting here.

00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:38.827
Look, you ignorant asshole.

00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:42.998
I threw you a book,
so read it or wipe your ass with it.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.001
Unless you wanna throw down.

00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:51.549
Hey. Ask around in Iri,
"Who's the baddest fucker in the city?"

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.386
What? You think I'm scared of a few scars?

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.764
You should take a good look
at this one right here.

00:50:58.847 --> 00:50:59.848
You ever been shot?

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:04.061
Hey. Did your balls fall off,
you piece of shit?

00:51:06.105 --> 00:51:07.565
Did you get what you wanted then?

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.900
I had a lot of work for him over here.

00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:14.530
You told me we need
to keep an eye on them.

00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:16.699
You're right. I did.
We could've sent anyone.

00:51:17.283 --> 00:51:18.784
Why did you send Jeonchul there?

00:51:19.451 --> 00:51:20.452
Hold on.

00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:23.247
Why can't I send my own employee?

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.042
What's with this tone?
What's gotten into you?

00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:29.044
Now, now, wait just a minute.

00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:32.381
You always get so worked up
any time it involves him.

00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:34.508
-What's going on there, huh?
-Nothing.

00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:38.804
Jeonchul's my right hand, and you just
sent him away. Do you understand?

00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:44.977
-Kim, listen.
-Yes, sir.

00:51:45.477 --> 00:51:47.313
I want you to be her right hand.

00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:49.732
And do whatever she asks of you, okay?

00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:50.816
Yes, sir. I will.

00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:53.986
Anyway, the people that we met…

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.822
What a strong impression.

00:51:58.073 --> 00:52:00.826
This isn't the kind of work
for soft guys, is it?

00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:02.578
You're right.

00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:05.456
I do hope they get along.

00:52:21.347 --> 00:52:22.723
Assholes!
