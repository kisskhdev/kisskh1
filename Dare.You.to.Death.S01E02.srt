1
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:03,065
The new inspector is here.

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:04,785
Hello, Captain Jade.

3
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:06,585
So you studied abroad.

4
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:09,625
-Are you as good as those in the movies?
-I bet you've watched too many movies.

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,865
I think these seven kids
are hiding something from us.

6
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:15,905
And this one is the worst liar.

7
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:19,185
Champ, why did you send me the letter?
What crap are you trying to pull on me?

8
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:20,265
Hey!

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,065
I'll be in your care from now on,

10
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:28,185
Inspector Kamin.

11
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,185
Hello?

12
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:30,505
Champ, why did you send me the letter?
What crap are you trying to pull on me?

13
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,465
What the hell is wrong with you, Tar?

14
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:36,225
Are you messing with me?
Where the hell are you?

15
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:32,905
We found midazolam
in the glasses and the liquor bottle.

16
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,985
It must have been mixed into the bottle

17
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:37,625
since the drug was found in every glass.

18
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,865
And the glasses only have fingerprints
from those seven kids, right?

19
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:46,705
Correct.

20
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:50,505
This looks like murder to me.

21
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,665
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

22
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,065
We need to wait for the autopsy report.

23
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:58,065
I'm just stating a possibility, Inspector.

24
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,865
I think whoever drugged them
was after something.

25
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,585
Are you sure you're not using drugs?

26
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:07,905
I'm clean.

27
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:10,985
Thank you.

28
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,345
We'll contact you
if we need anything else.

29
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,425
Of course, Inspector.

30
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:17,225
Here are the documents.

31
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,105
If you're sleepy,
maybe you should take a nap.

32
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:38,345
Fine. I'll go to sleep then.

33
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:45,865
Why are you staring at me like that?

34
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,385
You told me to sleep.

35
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,425
Have you ever heard of sarcasm?

36
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,105
This is work hours.

37
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,225
Why aren't you gathering more info on Tar?

38
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:11,545
Hello, Lieutenant Pai?

39
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,585
This is the Captain speaking.

40
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:16,785
Can you look into a boy named Tar?

41
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:20,025
I think there's something off about him.

42
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:22,545
Sure. Do you need anything else?

43
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:27,785
Check with our undercover team
about drug dealers around the area too.

44
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,065
I think these kids
might be using something,

45
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,345
but I want to know
where they're getting it from.

46
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,465
Understood.

47
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,905
I'll leave it to you.

48
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:46,065
So I can go to sleep now, right?

49
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:48,225
You command people with your mouth?

50
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,985
That's called teamwork.

51
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,745
Do you know what dividing tasks is?

52
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:58,505
And if I want to use my mouth to work,

53
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:00,905
why not?

54
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:04,665
My mouth works

55
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:06,905
pretty well.

56
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,265
Hello?

57
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:22,545
Hello, Inspector.

58
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,225
We have the autopsy results.

59
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,425
Got it. I'll be right there.

60
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,825
If you want to hear the results,
you can come along.

61
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:34,785
Or take a nap. I'm fine with that.

62
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:51,825
You told me to come with you, right?

63
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:54,145
Then drive yourself.

64
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:55,905
Don't you have a car?

65
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:57,945
Just so you know,

66
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,945
I'd rather die than ride with you.

67
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,585
I'll drive myself.

68
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:05,505
And who said you're riding with me?

69
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:13,185
Do you know 2025
is the hottest year on record?

70
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:18,705
I'm sorry,
but why did you even tell me that?

71
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,185
The more we drive,

72
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,745
the hotter the planet gets.

73
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:28,505
A good police officer should care
about the earth, right, Inspector?

74
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:45,945
Hello, doctor.

75
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:48,825
Hello.

76
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:51,825
We're sorry for the delay, Inspector.

77
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,865
Our forensic department is small,

78
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:55,345
so we have limited doctors.

79
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,385
It's all right.

80
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,265
Doctor, what do the test results say?

81
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:03,825
We found three substances
in the victim's blood.

82
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,105
Sodium thiopental,

83
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:08,065
pancuronium bromide,

84
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:09,945
and potassium chloride.

85
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,305
These three are used
for death row inmates.

86
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,225
REPORT: THREE SUBSTANCES FOUND

87
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:21,145
The cause of death is heart failure.

88
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:23,825
What exactly does that mean?

89
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:27,585
These three substances are
medical-grade drugs

90
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:31,265
that must be controlled
and used in precise doses.

91
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:36,425
And here,
there's a needle mark on her arm.

92
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:40,145
Judging from the mark,
it was injected shortly before she died.

93
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:45,865
So the killer injected all three drugs
into Puifai, correct?

94
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:48,065
Yes.

95
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,585
It was injected in an excessive dose.

96
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:54,705
Based on the results,
I'd consider it a murder.

97
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:07,265
The time of death is 12:15 to 1:00 a.m.

98
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,945
When did they make the call?

99
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,865
At 2:00 a.m.

100
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,105
So they called the ambulance first.

101
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,505
Correct.

102
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:21,425
Once we got the call, emergency responders
were dispatched immediately.

103
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:27,305
But aren't you a forensic doctor?

104
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:32,305
Yes, but we're short-staffed,
so we help other departments too.

105
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:34,585
That night,
when she called to report the case,

106
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:36,185
I personally answered it.

107
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:39,784
I think she called
sometime after 1:00 a.m.

108
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:42,305
Hold on.

109
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,625
She?

110
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,225
So it was a female caller?

111
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:51,025
Yes. It was a female's voice.

112
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:11,265
Then who actually called the ambulance?

113
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,745
Cherreen said Tonkla called, didn't she?

114
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:21,145
They might've just been confused
and given wrong statements.

115
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:27,985
Wrong statements
or intentionally misleading us?

116
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:30,145
Which do you think?

117
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,705
Lieutenant Pai reported
they still can't reach Tar.

118
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:49,505
If we want to know
whether they're messing with us,

119
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,065
we'll have to put pressure on Cherreen.

120
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,345
Where are you?

121
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:10,425
When the cops questioned you today,
did you say anything?

122
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,705
Let's meet this evening.

123
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,625
Same place.

124
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:21,945
Cher!

125
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,345
Why are you early?

126
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:30,025
Come on, let's get something to eat.

127
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,065
Champ, you asshole!

128
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:46,665
I'M AT THE BAR.

129
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:47,825
COME TALK TO ME, ASSHOLE.

130
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:01,465
Hey, relax.

131
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,265
Don't stress. Chill a bit.

132
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:06,545
Chill? How could I?

133
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,065
Unlike you, my dad is not a politician.

134
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:14,225
The police called earlier.
They said they're coming to meet me here.

135
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:16,425
Why?

136
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,545
I don't know.

137
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,025
They just told me to stay here
and not go anywhere.

138
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:29,185
Champ, can't your dad help me?

139
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,225
I'm scared.

140
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:33,625
Scared of what?

141
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,185
You didn't do anything wrong.

142
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:39,745
You know how panicky I get.

143
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,305
What if they ask something
and I panic and say something stupid?

144
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,145
Please.

145
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,545
Are you here yet, asshole?
Let's get this straight.

146
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,825
Did Tar send that?

147
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:00,385
Yeah.

148
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,825
He called this morning,
saying he got a letter.

149
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,425
He was talking nonsense, cursing nonstop,

150
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,585
telling me to meet him at the bar.

151
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,225
I don't know if he was high or what.

152
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:13,465
I have no idea
what the hell he was talking about.

153
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:16,825
He kept talking about truth or dare
over and over.

154
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:23,985
When are the police coming?

155
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:27,025
I don't know. I'm hungry.

156
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:29,225
-Should we go eat something first?
-Hello.

157
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:33,545
Oh, officers?

158
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,945
Do you have a problem with my friend?
You told her to wait here.

159
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,705
We're just asking for your cooperation.

160
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,345
Why are you upset?

161
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:48,065
I'll ask one more time.

162
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,825
Who called the hospital
the night of the incident?

163
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,105
Well…

164
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:54,225
Tonkla did.

165
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:56,385
But the hospital said
it was a female's voice.

166
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,145
The caller had a sweet voice.

167
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:01,305
Probably a girl in her twenties.

168
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:05,225
It sounded soft and nervous too.

169
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:08,665
It actually sounded a lot like you.

170
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:11,705
So who called?

171
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:14,545
It's not hard to spot a liar.

172
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,705
Maybe we just got confused.

173
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,905
It's just about who called.
Why are you making it a big deal?

174
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:27,145
Whoever called,
it was still one of my friends, right?

175
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,185
It's because your stories don't tally.

176
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,585
That's why we're finding out the truth.

177
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:34,665
If you were confused that night,

178
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,065
that's understandable.

179
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,825
You still can't think clearly today?

180
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,385
I… I'm sorry.

181
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:48,945
I was the one who called. I got mixed up.

182
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,905
Anything else
you haven't told the truth about?

183
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:58,865
No.

184
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,745
And did you two contact Tar?

185
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:05,705
What about him now?

186
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,585
You have to go see him again, huh?

187
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,825
If I find out any of you
are hiding evidence,

188
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:17,905
I will charge you
with obstruction of justice.

189
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:21,265
As for you,

190
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:25,465
I don't care who your father is
or how powerful he is.

191
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:29,505
Anyone acting suspiciously
will face charges.

192
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:34,185
Today is the last day I'll go easy on you.

193
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:55,785
But I honestly don't know
what Tar was rambling about.

194
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:58,505
He called me saying he got a letter.

195
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,865
He accused me
of sending it to mess with him.

196
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:02,705
I didn't do anything.

197
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:03,705
What letter?

198
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:04,625
No idea.

199
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,505
Something like a truth or dare letter.

200
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:09,985
Explain it clearly.

201
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,145
If you can't,

202
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,585
we'll bring you in for more questioning.

203
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:17,985
Champ, just tell them.

204
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:19,825
We didn't do anything anyway.

205
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,185
Let me be clear.

206
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,905
We have nothing to do with this.

207
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,265
Tar may look nerdy,

208
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:36,785
but he wears glasses to hide
the fact that he's a womanizer.

209
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,185
At first, he pretends he tutors girls.

210
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:42,425
After tutoring?

211
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:45,545
He doesn't send them home.

212
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,545
He drags them to a hotel.

213
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:07,465
If they resist, he drugs them.

214
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,745
He secretly records
every girl he sleeps with.

215
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,905
That's why none of them dares speak up.

216
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:20,665
When he's drunk, he brags about it.

217
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:26,145
But he looks so nerdy
that no one would suspect him.

218
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,585
He told me to meet him at the bar
to clear things up,

219
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:43,945
but I didn't go.

220
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,105
He's insane.

221
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:47,745
Who the hell has time
to send him a letter?

222
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,505
Which bar was it?

223
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,385
Drink Me, of course.

224
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:56,105
That's the Avengers' regular place.

225
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:58,265
Hey, stop sounding weird, okay?

226
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,625
Hey, hold on.

227
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,825
So that means Cherreen and I
are cleared, right?

228
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:16,464
It's not that easy.

229
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:17,944
What's with you?

230
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,825
You called me in
for an off-the-record interrogation.

231
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:22,825
I told you everything.

232
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:25,585
Why don't you keep your promise?

233
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,424
What kind of cops are you?

234
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:32,105
We're just collecting information today.

235
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,025
Right, Inspector?

236
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:41,025
And no one said
you two are off the suspect list.

237
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,305
But if you didn't do anything wrong,

238
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,265
you don't need to be scared, right?

239
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:55,865
Until we find the killer,

240
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,345
every one of you is still a suspect.

241
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:04,225
Let's go.

242
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,105
You saw that, right?

243
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:23,465
They were even linking arms.

244
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,625
I think something's off.

245
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:28,905
No wonder he doesn't even seem sad

246
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,985
about his girlfriend's death.

247
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,985
Didn't his politician dad
teach him anything?

248
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:37,665
He should have faked some grief

249
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:39,145
to hide his side chick.

250
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,625
Damn it!

251
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:07,985
Dude, what's wrong?

252
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,545
Have you been stressed lately?

253
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,425
Thank you.

254
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:15,705
Hey, look at that new girl.

255
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,105
She's as white as snow.

256
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,425
Let's take your stress off, okay?

257
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:27,025
-Yeah, a little release might help.
-Fine. I'll set it up.

258
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:37,865
Excuse me, my friend's interested.

259
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,945
Do you do off-site work?

260
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,865
Wait. You've got a condom?

261
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,505
No. Who carries one around?

262
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:58,785
Then I won't do it.

263
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,985
I already paid, so you're doing it.

264
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:02,225
How much?

265
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:03,145
Ten thousand?

266
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,745
I don't want the money. I want safety.

267
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,625
You look nerdy.

268
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,585
Don't you know what safe sex is?

269
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,065
Is 30,000 enough?

270
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,185
With this,
you won't have to work for days.

271
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,905
Fine. Once raw, once with a condom.

272
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,025
I'll go get one from my friend.

273
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,545
Fine. Such a hassle.

274
00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:51,505
Who are you?

275
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,945
What are you doing to me?

276
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:55,505
Don't come closer!

277
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:56,865
Help!

278
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:58,065
Asshole!

279
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,625
Truth or dare?

280
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,465
Truth! I'll talk now!

281
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:10,825
Truth!

282
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:23,785
Did you rape Puifai?

283
00:22:25,905 --> 00:22:27,545
-I didn't!
-Did you?

284
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,305
I said I didn't!

285
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:38,185
-Last chance!
-Wait, okay!

286
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:39,745
I did it!

287
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,265
I raped Puifai!

288
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,385
Let me go!

289
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:13,465
What are you going to do to me now?

290
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:15,625
I already told the truth!

291
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:20,345
Let me go!

292
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:22,385
I already told the truth!

293
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:44,385
Hey.

294
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:52,105
I think your suit

295
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,545
looks a bit tight today.

296
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,065
-That's none of your business.
-At least loosen your tie.

297
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,225
You've worn it all day. Let me help.

298
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,865
Just trust me a bit, okay?

299
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:10,665
Just once.

300
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,505
Let me help.

301
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:18,385
Here you go.

302
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,225
Isn't it uncomfortable
wearing something so tight?

303
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:24,625
Just undo one button.

304
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:27,225
That's it.

305
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,385
You're looking sharp.

306
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:31,345
Are you satisfied now?

307
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:34,025
All right, let's go inside.

308
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:44,145
Hey?

309
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:46,865
Hey!

310
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,105
There's nothing here.

311
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:21,265
You're sure we didn't miss any spots?

312
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:24,265
How would I know?

313
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:25,545
I don't own this place.

314
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:27,865
I don't know every corner here.

315
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:42,865
Hey, are you okay?

316
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:43,785
What happened?

317
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,265
Shit!

318
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:24,905
How was I supposed to know Tar would come?

319
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,665
Didn't you arrange to meet him?

320
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:30,265
Then why are you here?

321
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:32,065
I just came to drink.

322
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,985
I have other friends too.

323
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,905
What do you know
about the truth or dare letter?

324
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,345
What letter?

325
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,705
I told you I don't know anything!

326
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,265
Truth or dare, my ass.

327
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:19,665
You're sure?

328
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,145
Like I said,

329
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:26,905
I only went out to buy condoms.

330
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:30,145
Why did it take you so long?
You took almost 30 minutes.

331
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:35,825
I went to get one from my friend first,
but she didn't have any.

332
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,305
So I went to buy them myself.

333
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,465
When you came back, did you see anyone?

334
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:50,185
Okay.

335
00:27:57,305 --> 00:28:01,265
The closest convenience store
is 800 meters away.

336
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:08,545
I don't think that
the escort was lying to us.

337
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:13,385
She might still be an accomplice.

338
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:16,505
Have you checked the CCTV?

339
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:21,225
Yes, but the area where it happened
is a blind spot.

340
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,545
And the closest camera…

341
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:26,825
broke last night.

342
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,745
We need a new strategy.

343
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,225
We can't let them stay
a step ahead of us every time.

344
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,025
Agreed,

345
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,825
but we can't do anything else tonight.

346
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,785
We must head back.

347
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:45,265
Come. I'll drop you off.

348
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:47,705
Drop me off at my unit.

349
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:49,065
Are you crazy?

350
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,145
It's late.

351
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,385
Not sleeping enough is a quick way to die.

352
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:57,945
When I sleep and when I die
are my problems.

353
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:01,305
Give it to me.

354
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,145
No.

355
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,025
Hey!

356
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:13,545
Come on, Inspector!

357
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,465
Fine.

358
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,905
You want the key, right?

359
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,305
Here you are.

360
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:23,585
Just take it.

361
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:27,465
Hey, hold on!

362
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:28,545
How brave you are!

363
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:31,625
You're touching confiscated evidence!

364
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:37,385
What did you just say?

365
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,025
Don't you have any professional ethics?

366
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:43,425
You've been tense all day.
I just wanted to make you smile.

367
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:46,505
Come on, let me drive.

368
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:50,185
Hurry up.

369
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:56,585
A handsome, generous, kind,
and morally upright guy like me

370
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,185
doesn't come around often.

371
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:07,305
Oh, wow.

372
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:09,305
That actually works.

373
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:13,985
I changed my mind.

374
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:17,185
I'll take you to the hotel
so you can pack your things.

375
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:18,905
Pack? Why?

376
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:03,145
Hey, Inspector?

377
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:07,065
Is that all you're bringing?

378
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:11,345
Well, I don't know how long I'll stay.

379
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:13,225
Should I move my whole house?

380
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,945
Come on, Inspector.

381
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:16,785
Do you really not trust me?

382
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:21,145
Even a five-star hotel
can't help you sleep comfortably.

383
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:23,625
That's pretty bad, right?

384
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:25,265
You definitely need a new place.

385
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:28,625
Somewhere you can feel more comfortable.

386
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:32,945
Is that new place crowded?

387
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,185
I don't like crowds.

388
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:39,305
Inspector, I'm a local here.

389
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:42,265
I was born and raised in Bangkok.
Wherever I go, people know me.

390
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:46,145
I guarantee the new place
is more private than this place.

391
00:31:50,265 --> 00:31:51,425
Let's go.

392
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:53,145
I'm also offering you an extra service.

393
00:31:54,185 --> 00:31:55,305
I'll carry your luggage.

394
00:31:58,065 --> 00:31:59,465
Follow me.

395
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:07,745
Are you kidding?

396
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,265
You brought me to your house?

397
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:12,465
-No way. I'm going back to the hotel.
-Wait, Inspector.

398
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:14,065
Just try sleeping here first.

399
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:17,065
You couldn't sleep at the hotel anyway

400
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,745
and it's late.

401
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:20,985
Don't make things harder.

402
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:22,945
And if I still can't sleep?

403
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,705
Then go back to the hotel tomorrow.

404
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,505
Welcome to Jay-Jade Guesthouse.

405
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,345
So you're part of this too?

406
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:45,345
He said he'd split the rent with me.

407
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:48,345
Your room is ready
on the second floor, Mr. Kamin.

408
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:52,745
As for the rent,

409
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:55,225
I'll charge you only half the hotel price.

410
00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:58,225
That's such a great deal, right?

411
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:01,625
By the way, how much was the hotel room?

412
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:07,265
One hundred eighty thousand.

413
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,065
One hundred eighty thousand?

414
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:13,265
I chose a five-star hotel
so I wouldn't have to do anything.

415
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:15,625
That way, I could also focus on work.

416
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:19,745
We're also offering
a five-star service, right?

417
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,585
Then I'll give you a friendly price.

418
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:30,825
Fifty thousand.

419
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:34,545
Forty thousand.

420
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:37,345
Pretty worth it, right?

421
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:40,665
Think of it as circulating the economy.

422
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:43,545
That's more like circulating
from my pocket into yours.

423
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:48,945
So should we bring
the rest of your stuff tomorrow?

424
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:50,825
I haven't agreed to anything.

425
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:55,265
I'll stay for one trial night
with conditions.

426
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,945
If I'm not satisfied,
I leave whenever I want.

427
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:07,265
You're a tenant now, not an inspector.

428
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,744
Don't try to boss me around.

429
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:14,665
Whether it's one day or several,
write a contract.

430
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:17,865
I can't trust anyone easily these days.
There are too many scammers.

431
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:21,744
Okay. That's fair enough.

432
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,105
You really sound like someone
who studied abroad.

433
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:28,545
Then I'll start your service tonight.

434
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,304
You haven't eaten yet, right?

435
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,385
-Would you like anything?
-I'm not hungry.

436
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:34,865
I'll get back to work.

437
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:46,625
How about something simple then?

438
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:47,665
Chef Jay.

439
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:48,905
Yes?

440
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,744
What's on the menu tonight?

441
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:55,425
Tonight's dish features
the main ingredients from the Thai sea,

442
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:58,225
blended perfectly
with every regional flavor.

443
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:03,825
It's mackerel pasta
with spicy anchovy sauce

444
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:06,145
and seasonal vegetables.

445
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,025
What exactly is that?

446
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:10,745
What is that?

447
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:12,905
-Spicy fermented rice noodle salad.
-What?

448
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,625
Spicy fermented rice noodle salad.

449
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,025
I'll excuse myself for now.

450
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,745
We prepared breakfast for you, Inspector.

451
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:42,185
Did you sleep well last night?

452
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,305
Well, it was fine.

453
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:50,545
I'm sorry that
I'm not dressed very formally.

454
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:53,785
I had to wake up early
to cook breakfast for you.

455
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:58,745
But…

456
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:00,425
What?

457
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:04,905
I'm wearing pants, you know.

458
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,505
You should get used to this.

459
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,465
You're going to see it a lot.

460
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:16,905
Captain.

461
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:18,425
I'm moving out.

462
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:19,545
Oh no!

463
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,985
You can't order me around here.

464
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:24,665
You haven't even signed
the rental contract.

465
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:25,985
How can you move out?

466
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:27,185
Please take a seat.

467
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:38,545
Make yourself comfortable.

468
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,025
-Jay.
-Yes?

469
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,345
We need to talk.

470
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:53,585
What?

471
00:36:55,985 --> 00:36:57,385
You've heard about Tar, right?

472
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,985
Yeah.

473
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,345
We weren't that close, actually.

474
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:05,505
He was closer to Champ.

475
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:07,625
I still didn't expect him to die.

476
00:37:09,345 --> 00:37:10,545
Let me ask you a few things.

477
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:15,265
Were Tar and Tonkla close?

478
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:22,905
I never saw them hang out together.

479
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:27,785
Not even for drinks?

480
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,385
Like at Drink Me?

481
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,585
Drink Me?

482
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:34,905
No way Tonkla would go there.

483
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:37,665
He said it's expensive
and the drinks suck.

484
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:40,825
The only regulars there are Champ and Tar.

485
00:37:45,905 --> 00:37:47,425
And it's outside work hours.

486
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:49,825
I'm not answering anything else.
I'm off to class.

487
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:52,665
Goodbye.

488
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:00,665
If Tonkla doesn't like going to Drink Me,

489
00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:04,265
why did he show up there?

490
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:07,585
No idea.

491
00:38:08,465 --> 00:38:10,025
But for Tar's case,

492
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:12,465
we need to start at his house.

493
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:21,945
Guys.

494
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:25,025
Seriously, I'm kind of scared.

495
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:34,225
Did your brother tell you anything?

496
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:38,065
No. He keeps asking questions.

497
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:43,065
Did you tell him anything?

498
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:45,665
I didn't say a word.

499
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,105
Hey.

500
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:57,865
Did anyone get a truth or dare letter?

501
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:02,865
What the hell is that?

502
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:04,305
The cops asked me that too.

503
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,865
Cops?

504
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:11,505
How could they ask you?

505
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:14,545
I passed by Drink Me.

506
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,305
They recognized me and started asking.

507
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,105
Why were you there?

508
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:27,665
Where are you going?

509
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:29,825
I forgot I'd taken a job.

510
00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:34,145
All right.

511
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:37,705
What the hell is wrong with him?

512
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:41,305
Jade.

513
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:55,025
You sick piece of shit!

514
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:04,105
You know, sometimes
I almost side with the killer.

515
00:41:06,985 --> 00:41:08,825
No matter how shitty someone is,

516
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,425
no one has the right to play vigilante.

517
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:16,185
Have you found the letter yet?

518
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:19,585
Tar's mom said he rushed out.

519
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,865
It has to be around here.

520
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:28,225
Filthy bastard!

521
00:41:46,185 --> 00:41:47,305
Inspector.

522
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,185
This is no longer a simple murder.

523
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:17,425
The killer's targeting this entire group.

524
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:22,785
I think we're dealing

525
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:25,785
with a serial killer.

526
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:02,905
YOU KNEW WHAT THEY DID AND YOU DID NOTHING
BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT YOU OFF

527
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,705
Answer the goddamn call, you idiot!

528
00:43:18,785 --> 00:43:20,025
-Hello?
-Hello.

529
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:22,385
Jay, did you get the letter?

530
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:23,745
Don't lie to me.

531
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:26,785
Why are you so obsessed with the letter?

532
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:29,705
Stop being a smartass and just answer.
Did you get one?

533
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:32,705
No. Happy now?

534
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:34,545
Did any of your friends get one?

535
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:38,025
I don't know.

536
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:39,545
I'm hanging up.

537
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:40,745
Jay.

538
00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:41,665
Jay?

539
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:42,985
Hey!

540
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:45,625
Shit!

541
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:51,265
At least your brother isn't next.

542
00:43:52,705 --> 00:43:55,105
Given how dumb he is,
he could get picked anytime.

543
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:56,825
I'll deal with him myself.

544
00:43:58,705 --> 00:43:59,705
Hey.

545
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:03,185
This is exactly what the killer wants.

546
00:44:03,825 --> 00:44:06,745
If you do that, you're playing their game.

547
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,985
Don't give them what they want.

548
00:44:26,305 --> 00:44:27,825
What matters now is

549
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:31,425
keeping Jay in our sight at all times.

550
00:44:32,265 --> 00:44:33,545
For his safety.

551
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:45,345
Inspector.

552
00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:47,585
Let me be honest here.

553
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:51,545
Do you think the two of us
can really stop this?

554
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:58,065
If we work together,

555
00:44:59,185 --> 00:45:00,625
we'll catch the killer.

556
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:13,505
I'll stake my badge on it.

557
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:34,905
Hey.

558
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:37,745
Where are my clothes?

559
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:40,745
And what is this?

560
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:44,025
Pajamas.

561
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:47,425
Everything in the closet is yours to wear.

562
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:48,825
I'm generous.

563
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:53,785
And I already washed your clothes for you.

564
00:45:55,865 --> 00:45:57,785
I'll wear my own clothes.

565
00:45:58,705 --> 00:45:59,825
Give them back.

566
00:45:59,905 --> 00:46:00,985
Hey.

567
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:02,825
I'm the owner here.

568
00:46:04,705 --> 00:46:06,425
At the hotel,

569
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:08,305
dry cleaning was 1,000 per piece, right?

570
00:46:09,145 --> 00:46:10,305
Here at my place,

571
00:46:10,905 --> 00:46:12,865
I'll only charge 300.

572
00:46:12,945 --> 00:46:13,985
Deal?

573
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,665
Gotcha, look at your face.

574
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:19,145
You like it, don't you?

575
00:46:21,185 --> 00:46:24,505
My clothes need to be handled with care.

576
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,905
If they get damaged,

577
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,905
I'll charge you 10,000 per piece.

578
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,825
They won't get damaged.

579
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:35,865
You can even charge me 100,000,

580
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:38,465
but…

581
00:46:39,305 --> 00:46:41,625
I'll pay with my body instead.

582
00:46:46,465 --> 00:46:47,545
That won't be enough.

583
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,025
Hold on.

584
00:46:50,825 --> 00:46:51,865
Inspector.

585
00:46:55,465 --> 00:46:57,185
Don't worry, Inspector.

586
00:46:58,265 --> 00:47:00,545
Everything of yours…

587
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:06,665
will definitely be handled with care.

588
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:22,225
I want to know what the killer's motive is

589
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:23,945
and who the next target will be.

590
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:27,145
I just want to test Champ to see
if he's hiding something.

591
00:47:29,185 --> 00:47:30,585
Next time, you should be careful.

592
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:33,425
If something happens to you,
how am I supposed to live?

593
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:35,265
You're that desperate for me
to stay at your place.

594
00:47:35,345 --> 00:47:36,465
Are you lacking some warmth?

595
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:38,185
So are you going to give me that warmth?
