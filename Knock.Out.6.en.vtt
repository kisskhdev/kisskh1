This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.720
From now on, I’ll trust and support you.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.520
Thank you, Thun.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.240
Keen, do you know MP Phuwish?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.840
He’s a politician known for promoting Muay Thai.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.160
Oh, Tiger Taming Cannon himself.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.800
But I want one specific fighter to return to the ring.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.640
If you can bring him back to fight,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.800
I’ll fully support your event.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.000
So you’ve agreed to fight now?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.920
Yes.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.520
I’ve got a purpose now.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.200
Excellent.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.920
Don’t worry about the money.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.640
I’ll take care of it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.560
(MP Phuwish, I'm going to make him sink.)

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.240
Alright.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240
I’ll be watching.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.960
Come on everyone!

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.880
Cheers!

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.080
Yeah!

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.520
Woo!

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.640
Woah? Was it that refreshing?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.760
I've been tired for so long.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.520
Keen, you are really talented.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.600
I didn't think this event would really happen.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.400
I really want to thank you.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.080
It's ok.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.040
It's true.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.600
I never imagined

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.800
that we would ever get to fight in such a big event.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.080
Right?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.440
Keen is so talented!

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.120
Right, Bung?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.480
Yeah, I know.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.960
Just stuff your face with that junk food.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.600
Hey Thun, go with Keen to help him negotiate with the boxers, alright?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.440
Since this is our first time organizing an event,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.080
I’m worried people might not trust us.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.280
And don’t forget to bring some gifts or something with you.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.160
Got it, Coach.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160
Mmm-hmm.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.080
Come on, let’s do a bottoms-up!

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.000
Alright, cheers!
Whoa, bottoms-up?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.600
Cheers, cheers!
Come on!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.040
Bottoms-up!

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.240
Let’s go!
Bottoms-up, bottoms-up!

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.000
Bung, finish your drink!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.560
Don’t try to fake it, I saw you.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.640
We're out of beer, want to go buy more?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.040
I’ll go! I’ll go!

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.000
Isn’t anyone as hyped as I am?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.960
Am I the only one excited?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.000
For Us

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800
What's wrong?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.040
I don’t know.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.680
Suddenly I just feel scared.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.320
A fresh graduate organizing a boxing event…

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.600
I’ve never even watched a full boxing match on TV before.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.520
There’s nothing to worry,, Keen.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.640
We will make it through, like we used to.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.200
It’ll get better soon.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.560
Is that for me?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.760
Yeah.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.760
Let me put it on for you.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.960
Turn around.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720
Do you like it?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.360
Thank you, Thun.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.440
Could you put it on for me?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.280
Turn around.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.480
Thank you.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.200
Alright, you guys should head out now.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.080
Otherwise you’ll be back late.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.160
Call me if anything comes up.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.080
Will do.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.040
Hey, Thun, drive safe, okay?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.560
Safety first.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.280
Got it, Coach.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.440
Okay.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.360
We’re heading off.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.880
Bye.
Take care.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.960
Here you go.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.000
Thanks so much.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.160
Thank you.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.200
Anytime.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.840
Yeah.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.320
Now that we have Phuwish’s backing, it’s much easier to talk to the promoters.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.200
It’s all thanks to you.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.040
We managed to book all the boxers in one day!

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.760
(Come on, let's continue)

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.840
Kick!

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.360
Come on!

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.360
Kick!

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.840
Elbow!

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.480
Good!

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.480
Left, right.
Let’s go.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.560
Kick!

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.920
Elbow!

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.640
Good.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.520
When you were a kid, did Uncle Petch train you like this too, right?

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.520
Coach Petch wasn’t my first coach.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.240
It was my dad.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.320
Back then, we were really close.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.520
He’s the one who introduced me to boxing.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.080
He was always my idol.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.120
But then one day,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.440
he told me to quit boxing

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.640
and left me and my mother.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.960
He never came back.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.200
But I’m glad…

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.000
I still get to see you in the ring.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You never once gave up on boxing.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.640
That’s how you got this far.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.760
And it’s also thanks to you, Keen.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.400
When I was lost and on the verge of quitting,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.280
you made me realize

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.920
who I was doing this for.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.480
Thank you for always believing in me.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.960
Thank you too, Keen.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.280
From now on, I won’t be fighting for myself or for you,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.000
but for us.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.360
I will always be by your side.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.920
Stop it, Mai!

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.000
I’m just excited, Bung!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.280
Well, it’s giving me a headache

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.240
Just waiting for them to come back.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.960
Hey! Thun and Keen are back, everyone!

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.560
They’re here, they’re here!

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.960
This way!

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400
How’d it go, Keen?

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.160
I locked in all the boxers, Uncle.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.400
Whoa!
No way!

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.440
Really?!

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.880
Nice!! You’re awesome, boss!

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.480
Oops, sorry!

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.200
From now on, we should be calling him

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.560
Promoter Keen!

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.400
Not yet!

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.360
You did great, bro.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.320
Once the event comes together for real,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.240
then you can start calling him that, Mai.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.120
Yeah, you’re too quick with the titles.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.080
Huh?

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.960
Wow, now you’re siding with Bung?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.000
You’re just jealous that Keen got work for our gym, right?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.440
Aren’t you? Right, Keen?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.640
Hey Mai, help me wash the dishes.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.120
Come on, go!

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.640
Now??

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.520
Yes, now!

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.000
Huh?
Come on, or we’ll be up all night!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.320
Ugh, seriously?

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.200
You did amazing, Keen.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.840
Thanks.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.400
You too.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.120
You’re both amazing.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.080
Keen’s really impressive, huh?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.600
I mean, I’m the son of a boxing gym owner,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.840
but I still suck at boxing.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.640
Hey.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.000
Don’t say that.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.640
Everyone’s got their own kind of talent.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.080
So what do you think I’m good at, Ait?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.600
Well, you’re good at...

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.680
Hey!

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.200
What are you two still training for at this hour?

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.200
Go to bed already.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.960
If you’re not gonna sleep, go help Keen with his planning.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.520
Are you okay?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.440
I’m fine.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.640
Sorry about that.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.440
Does it really hurt?

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.440
I’m really sorry.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.040
It didn’t hurt.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.000
You don’t have to apologize.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.480
Honestly, I didn’t know what to do either.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.800
Finally done.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.560
I’ll try weighing on it now...

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.680
Hey!

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.840
It works now!

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.800
See? You’re the best at this kind of stuff.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.280
I'm good at fixing the scale?

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.680
You’re also good at crypto trading,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.520
and taking care of everyone in the gym.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.680
You’ve always done a great job at that.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.160
Actually… there’s something else you’re good at too.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.640
Let’s continue this in the room.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.440
Wait?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.200
Isn’t Mai in the room?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.280
Then let’s go to the office.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
Relax.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:02.440
This, this is what you’re best at.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.720
Give me a more intense look.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.720
More confident, yeah.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.640
Got it.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.120
Awesome.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.720
Can I see this photo real quick?

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.440
Perfect, this one’s great.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.360
Two more, please.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.160
A bit fiercer.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.000
Yes, good.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.880
Let me see that one.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.040
Next up is Bung!

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.240
You got this!

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.680
Let’s get a stunning shot.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.640
Bung, can you twist your body a bit?

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.160
That’s beautiful.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.800
Is that good?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.480
Perfect.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.560
Nice job.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.960
Next is Ait.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.480
(Bung, was your shot okay?)

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.360
(Yeah, I think so.)

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.920
Let’s go!
(Especially the knee-lift pose.)

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.920
Yeah.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.040
Whoa, Bung!

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:22.560
What?

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.720
Look at your photo.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.320
You look gorgeous.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.240
That pose!

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.280
That pose! Look at that!

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.840
Seems weird, you're complimenting me and laughing right after.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.120
Are you being sarcastic?

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.840
Check out your pose here!

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.600
Am I cool or what?

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.800
This air-con’s freezing, man.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.720
Aren’t you cold?

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.960
Not at all, I’m sweating like crazy.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.240
Seriously though, it’s freezing in here.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.600
No blankets either.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.240
We’ll take turns wearing jackets or something.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.480
Okay.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.680
Well, now that Klao’s here, it’s probably not cold anymore.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.960
Huh?

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.600
Definitely warmer now.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.720
So what were you guys doing earlier?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.840
Let me see.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.600
Here, Bung’s photos.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.560
Whoa, you’re really photogenic!

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.360
Told you, you look amazing.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.280
Thank you.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.800
See you at the event!

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.400
I going to go cover the story.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.440
I’ll be right by the ring cheering you on.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.960
Whoa.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.160
That means Bung’s gonna win in the first round, huh?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.480
Because someone she likes will be there cheering.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.280
Mai!

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.200
I mean…

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.280
Um… I’ve been a fan of Klao for a long time.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.680
Whoa, really?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.200
I’ve been following your news page for a while.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.000
Thank you so much, Bung!

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.240
If you enjoy anything I post, don’t forget to like and share.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.760
Of course!

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.960
Follow me.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.040
Sure.
I'll follow you back.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.120
I’ll go check on Keen.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.920
See you on event day.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.440
This is the first time

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.920
I’ve seen you so quiet, Bung.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.920
Well… but I still hit hard, okay?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.240
Wanna try?
Nope, please don’t.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.560
Come here!
Ah! Nooo~

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.560
So, how’s it going?

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.400
We're shooting Ait now.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.600
Ait looks a bit tense, huh?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600
Yeah.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.680
He still doesn’t look very confident.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.200
Ait, can we get a fiercer look?

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.600
Really confident, okay?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.720
Let’s try again.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.600
Do you want me to talk to him?

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.440
Yeah.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.080
Why?

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.520
Ait.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.400
Take a deep breath.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.240
How about this?

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.480
If you do well, I’ll give you a reward.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.280
Deal?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.960
Keep going, Keen.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160
Let’s roll, Ait.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.320
Awesome!

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.120
What did you say to him just now?

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.640
Nothing much.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.160
You're awesome.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.600
I better not find out…
Elbow strike! Elbow strike!

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.040
Uh..

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200
Uhh…

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.840
Nice.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.000
I'm trying to figure out when they got so close?

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.080
That's great.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.800
Elbow, elbow.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.560
I have no clue.
How about this?

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560
That's great.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.200
You got it, Ait.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.680
You did really great.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.120
Well done.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.520
Awesome.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.000
The photo looks so cool.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.480
How are you feeling?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.400
Thanks, bro.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.400
Come on, go take a break.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.400
I’ll take you.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Next up is you.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.280
Mmm.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.920
You got this.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.400
I can smell love in the air.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.080
So cool.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.760
Why are you smiling?

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.560
The photo’s amazing.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.240
Oh, okay.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.640
Just looking at the pictures.
The whole shoot turned out amazing.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.360
Yeah.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.160
Incredible.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.200
Great job, Thun.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.240
Hello, Keen.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.960
Oh, hello.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.160
How’s it going?

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.680
Good.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.880
We’re still shooting right now.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.080
Aren’t you getting your photo taken too?

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.160
Alright, Yut, let’s get a photo of you two together.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:13.800
Oh, sure.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.320
Okay then.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.040
We meet again, Thun.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.720
Photo time.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.400
Are they fighting...

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.440
because you're the prize?

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.280
If that’s the case, no need to compete anymore.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.880
Huh?

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.960
Because I've already picked the winner.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.400
Figures.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.440
You're on fire.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.200
Can’t be helped.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.240
I’m gonna puke.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.480
Both of you, guard up and face the camera.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.760
Give me a fiercer expression, please.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.280
Are they acting or actually mad at each other?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.280
I'll go brief them.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.360
Hurry up,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.920
they’re about to throw punches.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.520
One moment, please.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.120
Now turn to face each other.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.160
Put your guard up like you're about to fight.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.200
Angrier faces, please.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.240
A little more rage in your face, Thun.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.280
So how do I look, Keen?

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.080
Do you like it?

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.120
You look alright.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.480
Looks great.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.160
Now face each other again.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.440
Pose like you're about to fight.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.120
Okay.
Give me your angriest looks.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.960
Let’s keep shooting.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.080
Sure.
Alright, let’s go for it.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.520
Nice.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.880
That's awesome.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.680
Ooh, this photo’s amazing.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.120
Looks great.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.000
And here are the fighters of this Hero Fight event!

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.120
Let’s give them all a round of applause!

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.080
Woo!

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.320
Thun!

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.000
If there’s someone you love or support, cheer them on!

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.640
Don’t worry.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.360
You’ve done really well.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Thank you, Mr.Phuwish.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.200

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.640

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:08.680
Woo!
Go Cannon! Go!

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.360
And for this Hero Fight event, we also have official merchandise on sale:

T-shirts, tote bags, water bottles, fans, and souvenirs.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.720
Do you think it’ll really sell?
(For those of you here and at home,)

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.120
It will, Keen's thought it through.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.240
Now, can we please invite all six fighters to the front for a group photo?

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.880
Can I get a round of applause?!

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.680
Wooo!

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.040
Alright, let’s start with the first pose.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.560
Each pair, please face each other and get into your guard stance.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.120
Media friends, feel free to start taking pictures.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.560
If you have a favorite pair, you’re welcome to cheer for them.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.160
Alright, if everyone's got their shots, let’s move on to the second pose.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.120
All six fighters, please turn and pose for the fans!

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.000

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.200
Let’s give them another big round of applause!

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.160

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.480
(“That’s that hero boxer guy!”)

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.760
(Yut, the retired boxer turned rescue volunteer, returns to the ring)

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.880
(“Whoa! The Warlord is back!”)

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.080
(“He’s not only a great fighter but also super handsome!”)

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080
(“Hero vs. Hero, OMG!”)

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.360
(“This is the first time I’m excited to watch a boxing match.”)

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.640
(“Hot rescue guy, tell everyone!”)

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.920
(“Go Thun! You got this!”)

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.480
(“Yut is seriously cool.”)

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
(Ticket sales: 127/1000)

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.480
Everyone, it's been ten minutes.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.320
Let’s check the numbers.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.120
(Ticket sales: 157/1000)

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.880
What do we do, Keen?

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.760
A thousand seats and less than two weeks to go...

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.360
Can we really sell them all?

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.720
Engagement’s good, but realistically… yikes.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.000
It’s the brutal truth, man.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.920
You didn’t time this at all.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:50.200
My generation doesn’t even know what this sport entertainment thing is.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.720
But the engagement from both the event and Thun is really strong.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.600
Honestly, we should’ve sold more tickets by now.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.840
Don’t stress, Keen.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.400
Boxing fans might just buy at the door.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.120
Are you guys forgetting something?

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.760
I’m a content creator, remember?

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.480
Got loads of followers?

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.640
Let me handle it, I’ll make three pieces of content.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.600
Free of charge.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.040
Go ahead Mr. Influencer!

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.960
I’ll go post some posters around, maybe more people will notice.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.960
Also, Bung, we’re almost out of posters.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.760
Go print more and hand them out at the market.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.480
Make your rider service useful for once.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.320
Wait, where’s Ait?

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.640
He’s at the hospital with his sister.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.000
She’s having surgery today.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.640
Don't make up excuses.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.640
I’m not making excuses, I’m just finding someone to go with.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.240
Is this it?

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.920
I’m out.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.520
That’s a hardware wallet, not a flash drive.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.360
A what now?

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.800
What’s a hardware wallet?

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.000
Told you a hundred times.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.040
It’s for storing crypto, genius.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.200
Give it to me.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.200
Come on, how much money could it possibly hold?

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.360
Let’s just say it’s got some!

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.400
Alright, alright! Break it up!

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.000
Everyone scatter.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.440
Where’s the file?

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.560
I’ll send it over.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.360
Okay, cool.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.080
I’m out, see you.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.400
See you.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.880
Mr.Phuwish is calling.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.080
Hello, Mr. Phuwish.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.480
Can you meet me at my office now?

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.280
We’ve been working on the promotion pla..

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.200
Hello, Mr. Phuwish.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.440
Hello.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:33.440
This is Noey, producer and owner of Sports Gossip show.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.600
I'm here with great news, we want to film a promo segment for tomorrow’s match.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.000
Go right ahead.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.160
So, you're saying we get to promote on their show?

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.960
Uh-huh.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.800
Oh, but I might need a small favor from you, Keen.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.000
Can you come up with a little gimmick for it?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.840
Just a simple chat might be too boring.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.120
You’re free to go all out.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.480
Got it, I’ll take care of it.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.560
Great.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.520
I know it’s a bit last-minute,

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.480
But I believe you can handle it, Keen.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.640
Oh, and please take care of Yut for me.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.720
Sure.

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.120
Mhm.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.800
You’ll figure it out.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.720
Keen.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.000
Are you super stressed?

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.400
Who uses their real voice for this kind of thing?

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.760
You gotta switch to your second voice!

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.760
Come on, try it.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.400
Keen~

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.200
Keen~ Don’t stress, okay?~

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.520
Thun and I ~

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.520
will punch all your problems away!~

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.600
Hey.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.720
Don’t worry.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.200
You’ll come up with something.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.200
I haven't drank it today.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.000
Can Thun have a sip?~

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.760
Please~?

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.640
Here you go.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.640
Please hold this.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.360
Thun!

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.120
I've figured out what we’re gonna do for the show!

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.920
Hello everyone!

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.240
Let me take you behind the scenes and show you what the fighters’ dressing room looks like.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.000
Let’s see how everyone’s getting ready.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.480
Whoa~ Looks like Keen is busy right now,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.360
so let’s skip him for now.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.840
Who's behind the curtain, everyone?

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.320
Let me pull it open for you!

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.720
Peekaboo! Oops!

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.720
No one saw anything, okay?
Get lost, Mai!

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.600
No one saw!

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.720
They’re getting dressed!

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.240
Whoa, can I take this back to wear at the gym, Bung?

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.600
What, are you jealous of me or something?

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.560
Nah.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.920
It’s just that a guy like me looks good in anything.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.960
Ugh, so annoying.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.240
Alright, let’s keep moving.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.280
Than, say hi to your fans real quick!

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.400
Whoa, Than looks insanely handsome today.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.480
That’s why he’s my number-one idol, everyone.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.080
You’re hyping me up this much and I’ve only got twenty baht on me.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.720
Doesn’t matter how much, I’ll take it all.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.720
Times are tough, after all.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.000
Anyway, that’s a quick peek at the dressing room.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.800
I’m gonna end the live here, folks.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.320
Signing off for now!

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.080
I’ve never dressed like this before.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:51.760
If it wasn’t for this shoot, I probably never would’ve worn something like this.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.760
Well then, wear it again tonight.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.120
But just the bunny ears.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.680
Sure thing.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160
Hey!

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.200
Keep your voice down, people might hear us.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.560
Let go.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.560
Let go!

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.240
You know what, better take it off.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.600
Because you look best in this outfit, Ait.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.040
Take care of it, yeah?

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.560
Of course.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.280
Bro...

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.800
What?

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.600
Hi everyone!

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.240
I noticed you guys have been working since super early this morning,

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.880
so you probably haven’t had anything to eat yet.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.040
I’m all dressed now, so I stopped by and got some donuts for everyone.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.680
Ooh!

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.080
Please help yourselves!

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.560
Handsome and kind too, wow!

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.920
This one’s for you too.
Thank you so much, Yut.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.040
From a famous shop too!

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.280
Perfect timing! I was just getting hungry, you totally read my mind.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.640
Oh, Than!

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.840
Didn’t think I’d see you again until the event itself.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.320
Keen, I’m feeling kind of thirsty.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.320
If it’s not too much trouble…

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.920
Oh, of course! One sec.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.320
Thanks!

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.160
Here you go.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:06.640
Hey!

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.480
Oops!

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.800
I'm really sorry.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.320
I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to spill it.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.440
It’s okay.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.320
I'm really sorry.
It’s alright,it's just a small splash.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.280
No big deal.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.440
Keen, can you go help test the equipment?

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.320
Sure, no problem.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.160
Sorry again!

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.720
It’s fine, really.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.160
Mai, let’s go.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.480
The host sits here, right?

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.160
Yeah, that’s right.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.240
Okay, got it.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.080
And...

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.040
And the guests…

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.200
Got it. One, two, three, four, five.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.200
And this area in the back…?

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.880
That’s all set up already, right?

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.400
Great, let me know if there’s anything else I can help with.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.040
Will do.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Mai!

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.200
It looks so awesome.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.240
Try it!

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.120
Can I really hit it, Keen?

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.000
Go for it, full power.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.600
Alright, film me!

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.800
Got it.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.040
Alright, here we go.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.240
Whoa.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.600
Woah.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.320
Wow.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.600
I’ve got a knack for this, huh?

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.800
That's really good.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.240
You’re strong, Mai.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.800
Of course!

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.840
I’ve trained a bit too, you know.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.880
Everything’s ready now.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.720
You can get started.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.720
Thanks so much!

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.400
Right this way.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.600
Mai.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.680
Let's have our fighters sit inside first.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.720
Got it.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.400
Come on.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.680
Whoa, look at that!

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.880
Hello everyone,

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.040
Welcome to another episode of Sports Gossip! I'm your host, Noey.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.720
Today we’re joined by the fighters from Hero Fight,

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.760
as well as the event promoter, Keen! Let’s give them a big round of applause.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.640
Before we get started, let’s have Keen,

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.240
the promoter of this event,

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:30.000
tell us a bit about the concept and how this event came to be.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.840
Hero Fight is an event hosted by the Petchsak Gym.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.840
The event's Theme is hero versus hero

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.880
which was inspired by Thun and Yut's story.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.280
Which is the leading match for this event.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.680
Wow! The main fighters are this cool and handsome?

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.720
That's so interesting!

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.240
Today, our show is teaming up with Keen to come up with some fun activities

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.360
to showcase the fighter spirit in each boxer, right?

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.320
That’s right! It’s like a warm-up before the big event.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.120
Ah, a warm-up!

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.920
And this might be the warm-up machine, right, Keen?

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.640
Exactly!

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.800
Hey, this looks fun and exciting to play.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.880
Let’s not waste any more time.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.800
Team, please go ahead

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.520
and set up the machine.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.800
Shall we all move over there together?

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.000
Let’s see who scores the highest!

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.760
Here we go, Keen!

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.440
Let’s test the fighter power of each boxer, shall we?

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.160
Let’s do it.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.360
Starting now!

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.720
Whoa, and that’s just the first one!

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.640
Give them a round of applause!

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.640
Alright, next person, come on up.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.160
Small but mighty! Come on!

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.280
Whoa!
Wow!

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.560
Everyone’s putting up big numbers!

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.160
Bung!

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.920
You got this, Bung!

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.600
Great form and a beautiful face too!

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.320
Beautiful face and beautiful form, that’s what you get with this camp!
And the score is high too. Amazing!

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.720
Give her a round of applause!
Great job!

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.920
Next up is Ait.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.640
Ait.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.400
Please step up, Ait.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.840
Sure.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.160
Oh no, Ait’s score is kinda low…

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.360
He's warming up.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.440
He’s just warming up, warming up! No worries.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.400
It’s all good, it’s just a warm-up. Don’t stress.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.000
Alright, give it up for Ait, everyone!

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.920
Now we’ve arrived at our main fighter!

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.520
Thun, please come up.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.840
Go Thun!

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.960
Okay, if you’re ready, let’s begin.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.120
Whew! Thun!

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.880
Amazing numbers!

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.040
Truly fitting for the main event.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:22.960
Exactly.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.320
Powerful punches!

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.640
Highest score so far!

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.560
Might’ve broken the machine!

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.440
Next is Yut, also one of our headliners.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.480
If you’re ready, go for it!

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.280
We heard you’ve been away from the ring for a while, right?

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.840
Exactly.
Let’s see how you do… let’s see…

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.320
Whoa, Yut!

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.320
Give it up for Yut, everyone!

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.480
His punches are insanely powerful!

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.840
Even stronger than Thun’s!

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.680
Are you sure you’ve really been retired from boxing?

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.960
People say you’ve been out of the game for a long time,

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.520
so how are your numbers still this high, Yut?

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.600
Well, I actually still exercise every day.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.360
Hey, let me see—wait, no I can’t!

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.400
Thun!

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.880
You can’t underestimate him now.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.160
Your opponent is seriously strong, he works out every day!

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.760
Right?

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.720
Alright, how about we take a short break.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.200
We’ll be back in just a bit for the final segment.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.960
This is our last part, so we’ll have one rep

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.960
say some closing words about this Hero Fight showdown.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.440
Sure.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.960
I’d like to ask everyone to support the show.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.800
Even though this is Keen’s first time as a promoter,

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.720
he’s really giving it his all—everyone is.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.360
Please cheer everyone on,

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.640
including me too.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.360
There’s definitely some chemistry going on here.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.080
Yut and Keen—aww, so cute together!

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.400
Ahh, stop, I’m blushing!

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:58.200
Come on, play it up! If the ship gains traction, maybe we’ll sell more tickets!

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.080
Well?

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:19.440
Yut and Keen!

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.280
Whoa, they even made a heart sign!

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.520
They made a heart! So cute, I’m dying!

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.480
Thun!
Hey! Thun!

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.360
What’s your deal?
Thun!

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.520
Thun!
Say something!

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.720
Wait, what?

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.440
Hey!

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.120
What’s wrong with you?

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.400
Thun?
Thun?!

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.640
Hey! Hey!
Thun!

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.680
Hey! Hey! Uh…
Thun!

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.760
Oh shit…

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.560
And that was the show we prepared!

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.560
If you really want to see these two fight for real…

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.680
Don’t forget to buy tickets and come to the event!

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.960
Ah, a surprise?

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.640
Yup!

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.000
It’s a surprise!

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.840
Give them a round of applause!

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.840
Let’s all go see the real thing at the event!

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.280
And that’s it for today. Goodbye, everyone!

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.320
Goodbye.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.560
Whoa, turns out it was all staged?

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.280
Right?

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.320
Right, boss?

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.880
Uh… okay then. Surprise.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.720
You planned this.
It’s okay.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.440
You planned this.
Yes, yes.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.080
It’s okay.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.400
I think their relationship might be real.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.560
Yeah, looks very real.
Thank you.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.000
Thun, why can’t you control your emotions?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.560
He harassed you! You want me to just let it go?

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.520
It’s not like I'm not mad.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.120
But who would’ve thought he’d do that?

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:46.600
This is a live show—what if we can’t sell the tickets?

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.560
You really had to go as far as becoming a fake couple with him?

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.800
Maybe it’s not just about selling tickets anymore?

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.680
You really want to know, huh?

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.200
Ait, are you ok?

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.200
I’m not okay at all.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.400
I got a lower score than Mai whose not even fighting.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.720
What am I supposed to do?

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.360
What if I lose to him…

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.200
It’s okay, Ait.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.520
Don’t say another word.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
I get it.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.040
But winning or losing, that’s decided in the ring, Ait.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.960
Thanks, boss.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.800
You’ve got this, Ait.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.000
Aaaah!

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.600
This match is a war for love?!

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.520
I wanna go watch!

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.760
You mean Hero Fight?

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.280
Hmm… more like a battle for her heart.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.800
And when Yut and Keen,

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.120
they made a heart shape together~

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.320
Then Thun just ran in and grabbed Yut’s collar!

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.640
But honestly, don’t they have great chemistry?

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.360
Yut, the former fighter?

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.080
He’s now a rescue worker.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.880
And Yut and Keen used to volunteer at a children’s hospital together.

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.240
Remember that time

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.080
when he helped Keen who was getting beaten up?

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.280
The whole feed was obsessed with the hero-fighter storyline.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.640
After that, his gym even posted boxing tutorials.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.520
It broke the internet!

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.880
So spicy.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.960
Let’s just think for fun~

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.080
Who do you think is Keen’s real match?

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.440
What do you guys think?

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.480
Don’t forget to comment!

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.840
And hit that heart button too!

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.160
(Tickets Sold Out)

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.840
Yay!

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.120
We did it!

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.600
All sold out!

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.240
You did it, Keen.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.160
You really did it.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.640
Well well, look at you two making it official.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.000
You’ guys are officially dating, huh Thun?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.920
It’s not like I’m hiding.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.320
Psh, I never hid it.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.200
Never once.

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.800
I’ve never kept it secret.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.920
Thanks so much, Keen, for giving us this match.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.720
Huh? What did you say, Bung?

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.320
