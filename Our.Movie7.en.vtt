OUR MOVIE

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.199
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.701
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:35.953
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.471
Why do you keep denying it?

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.598
I know I messed up.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.226
Just have a bite.

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.146
You yourself know it best.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.900
Every cell in your body knows.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.487
That it's love.

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.366
No, I'm not so sure.

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:23.750
Something is stirring in me,

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.962
but I don't know if I can call that love.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.883
Or if I'm even someone worthy of it.

EPISODE 7

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.521
I said, is it true?

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:46.982
Are you really dying?

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.618
Yes.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:00.662
I'm dying soon.

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:04.833
It won't take long.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.795
Oh.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:11.840
This is how actors joke around.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:17.387
You nailed it.
Lines should come out just like that.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.225
I practiced so much,
I could recite them in my sleep.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.911
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.079
Did you drink?

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.123
- No.
- I didn't drink either.

00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:48.001
I saw your manager
drinking earlier though.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:49.836
How are you getting home?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.673
I can just grab a taxi.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.384
Come with me, I'll take you home.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.845
No, I can go on my own.
You don't even know where I live.

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.305
Doesn't matter.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.598
What?

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:02.933
Nothing.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.768
It's cold, let's go inside.

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:06.561
Yeah.

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.816
Are you two into each other,

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:15.404
or are you just slapping a cliché scandal
on top of an already cliché film?

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:19.991
But you know,

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.245
I think clichés actually work these days.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.081
Remember Jungin's film?

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:29.251
It broke even ages ago and became a hit.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:33.672
Everyone said it would flop
because of that messy scandal.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.259
But surprise, that kind of thing
could be a strategy these days.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:42.055
If that's what you wanted,
you should've gone with Director Park.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.641
I was going to drop an article,

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:48.728
and there just happened to be
a lot of photos where you and Daeum

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:51.565
were glued together.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.527
What, you expect the director
to stay apart from the lead?

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.038
Oh. You two heading out?

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.331
Yes, we're calling it.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.543
Mr. Lee.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.711
Yes?

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.129
See you soon. I'll be in touch.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.298
Okay.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:18.967
Okay, bye.

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.599
- Oh.
- Ah.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.145
Uh, we went to college together.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.400
Where are you going, Daeum?

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:37.944
I'm going home.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.530
Right. Where's Junbyung?

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:44.117
He was drinking.
I told him I'd take a cab by myself.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.454
Don't worry, Mr. Lee.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.790
I'll make sure she gets home safe.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.417
Okay, then. I'll see you on set.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:54.753
Yes, take good care of her.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.547
Have a good night.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.610 line:20%
TAXI
RESERVED

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.112
Thanks. I'll just go on my own.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.989
You're really keeping your distance.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.075
You get home safe too, okay?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.952
Can I call you?

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.747
I'll just see you on set.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:04.447
<i>Are you wondering</i>
<i>whether this is love or not?</i>

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.507
I saw Eunho.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.136
Jeong Eunho?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.763
- Yeah.
- Your first love?

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:30.599
Where?

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.059
He's working on our film's
camera crew for a bit.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.269
Camera crew?

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.396
Hang on.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.692
That means you saw
your first love again after five years.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:44.988
Wait,

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.574
so you're working with your first love?

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:48.700
Exactly.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.452
You know…

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:54.164
I used to wonder

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.875
what I'd feel if I ever saw him again.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.293
Yeah, and?

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:01.546
I was glad to see him. Bit surprised.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.381
That's it.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.425
That's it? Not even a tiny spark?

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.177
That's what I'm saying.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.262
Oh, boy.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:14.184
Seeing your first love again
and feeling nothing…

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.853
Maybe it's because of him.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.898
- Huh?
- You know, the guy

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.692
you said hurt you so badly
you almost cried.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.195
Hey, I told you that wasn't me.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.446
Wait, hold up.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.408
That means your first love and that guy
are working together too.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.745
- Are you looking at the time? Go to work!
- Oh, man.

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.413
All right, I'm going.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.667
- Ah, you're the center of a love triangle.
- Just go!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.085
Hurry up and go!

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.594
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.521
LEE DAEUM

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:00.605
Mr. Lee.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:04.693
Mr. Lee!

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.990
Well,
there's no way you're hungover.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.410
- You didn't drink at all.
- Right.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.996
Just need your okay
on the shooting schedule.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:28.258
I meant to mention this.
Could we bunch up Daeum's scenes…

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.678
a little more?

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.056
Cut down her shooting days if possible.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.142
Even more than this?

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.354
But that means she'll wrap up
a month before the other actors.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:46.317
Wouldn't the rest of the cast complain
if we go too far?

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.777
Compared to Daeum, everyone's more--

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.571
She's a rookie, you know?

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.699
I just want to help her stay focused.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.493
Sure, people might
hate us for it, but I agree.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.079
She's an unproven rookie.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.624
We'll have to think about replacing her
if it doesn't work out.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.502
Frontloading her scenes
lets us decide early.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:08.256
You shouldn't say something
that ominous like it's nothing.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.719
A good producer prepares
for every kind of scenario.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.304
Okay, Assistant Director?

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.515
Yes, Mr. Bu is right.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.935
Let's go with that
and wrap up here for today.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.812
Shall we?

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.439
We should talk, Director Lee.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.403
Cold-blooded,
the both of them.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.493
Mr. Han will be there on the first day.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.453
Mr. Han? Why?

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.413
Why do you think? Lee Daeum.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.918
Didn't we settle all that
with the test shoot?

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.921
When is anything in this world
ever that simple?

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.964
I tried to talk him out of it.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.883
But the reason's even more absurd.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.469
Apparently, he's bored and curious.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.142
Let's give what we can give,
and take what we can take, Director.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.867
LEE DAEUM
CELL PHONE

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.123
LEE DAEUM

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.210
MR. LEE, I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.
CAN YOU SPARE A MOMENT?

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:35.051
Are you feeling okay, Ms. Chae?
Should I cancel your afternoon interview?

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.972
You throw "cancel" around too easily.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.016
I'm fine.
I just didn't sleep well, that's all.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.477
You don't look fine at all.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.480
My team was just too slow.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.232
I need help from a pro.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:52.777
Of course, leave the digging
to the journalist.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.862
You can count on me.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.239
I'll pay however you want.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.241
Money, information, anything.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.617
I accept credit too.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:03.997
Hello.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:08.501
- What brings you here, Mr. Noh?
- Wow. Long time no see, Seoyoung.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.587
You two know each other, right?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.674
Noh Huitae, the reporter you once made
a request to behind the company's back.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.718
Not a request, a press release.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.387
Looks like you're the one
making a request.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.974
Mmm, press release, request, whatever.
It's none of your business.

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:24.517
Go on, get her out of here.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.603
Yes. Let's head out, Ms. Chae.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:27.770
Ms. Go.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.773
Are you digging into Lee Daeum?

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:31.983
Why?

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.319
I said, get her out of here.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:35.486
Ms. Chae.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.822
If you're trying to win someone over,

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.074
you should know this isn't the way.

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.535
Your playbook never changes.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.505
Oh. Well, that was intense.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.758
She's just touchy.
Contract renewal's coming up.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.093
So what will you do with Chae Seoyoung--

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.681
Look into Lee Daeum for me.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.141
Thoroughly.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:19.864
Daeum!

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.243
Oh? Eunho.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:24.911
What brings you here?

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.079
Signing my contract.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.998
Hello, Mr. Lee. We meet again.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.000
Yes, hello.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.380
Why didn't you text me back?

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.840
Oh, I didn't?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.051
Perfect timing. Let's grab a bite.

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.803
- Are you free?
- Right now?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.972
Oh, food?

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.724
Right now is a bit…

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.188
Mr. Lee.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.856
Come eat with us.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.317
The three of us
eating together sounds great.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.987
My manager actually owns a restaurant,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.488
and the food is amazing.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.074
Hey, this is perfect.

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:05.535
I'll lead the way.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:09.122
LIMCINE RESTAURANT

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.924
There.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.927
Enjoy.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.730
What's with the alarm?

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.773
Yours went off at the same time.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:38.401
Yeah, that's strange.

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:44.866
No, let me.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.038
- Daeum.
- Yeah?

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.914
Slow down.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.250
Right. I must've been hungry.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.088
This is a new mix of people.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:00.590
You two seem pretty close.

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:02.300
Still a bit awkward.

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:04.260
We're getting to know each other.

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.304
Getting to know what?

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.556
Each other.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.564
It's not every day
that schoolmates meet again on set.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.192
I hope you two can help each other out.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.070
Sure.

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:25.990
<i>How was your audition?</i>

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:27.867
I didn't go.

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:29.744
Next time.

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:32.455
I want to go when I'm more prepared.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.459
Funny how things work out.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.169
Hmm?

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:39.420
What did you say?

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.049
It's nothing.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.930
It's good, try it.

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.348
Thank you.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:11.285
Me asking you to eat all of a sudden,
was that too much?

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:15.581
Not at all. It was nice,
eating together again after so long.

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.503
It still feels unreal.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:21.587
What does?

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.507
That we're working together,

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:26.926
even if it's only for two weeks.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:28.678
And…

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.847
that you made it.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:34.976
You told me back then

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.561
you'd audition

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.147
when you were more prepared.

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.023
And now,

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:43.776
you made it here.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.487
On the same director's film too.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.031
You remember all that?

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.116
Of course.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.452
It still feels unreal that I get to be
right next to you while it happens.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.912
I'm just happy for you.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.667
Thanks, that means a lot.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.045
If you're free after this--

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.505
Sorry, Eunho.

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.716
I have somewhere to be. Get home safe.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:07.800
I'll be off now.

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:34.869
Oh? Daeum, you're back.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.414
Why did you come back?

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.173
Mr. Lee, could you look at me?

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.847
You knew I'd be back, didn't you?

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:56.807
No, I didn't.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:58.434
Oh, hmm.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.937
Anyway, I'm back.
I've got something to say.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:04.982
And what's that?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.110
Want to go see a movie with me?

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.385
I just wanted you to forget for a bit.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.055
Forget what?

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.934
You're always thinking,

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.563
planning, and calculating.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.857
I wanted you to forget all that
while you're here

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.943
and lose yourself in the movie.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.407
Thank you.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.867
I did manage to forget for a little while.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.374
Do you think I…

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.878
No, we can finish our movie?

00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:09.797
Like this one.

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:13.301
We have to.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:15.595
We will.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:21.100
And once our movie's finished,
how will it be remembered?

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:31.736
I don't know how it'll turn out
or how it'll be remembered either.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:33.946
Hmm.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:35.865
What if

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.284
it totally bombs,

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:41.329
you fall into another long slump,

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:44.790
and I'll be there to pretend
to cheer you up but actually bug you.

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:49.920
Well, that sounds highly plausible.

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.298
Or maybe

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:55.051
we'll get invited to film festivals
around the world

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.969
and win award after award.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.680
We go to France, we go to America…

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.641
That would be awesome.

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.518
Going global is
the trend these days, right?

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:07.688
Let's find out together.

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:09.690
Sorry?

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:13.653
I'm not sure how our movie
will turn out or be remembered…

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.156
so let's you and I

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.325
find out together.

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.625
Okay, I've bothered you enough today.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.130
Let's keep on like this.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.007
Sometimes forgetting,

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.009
and often laughing.

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.512
That's more than enough for me.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.308
I'm going to head out first.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.812
I'll see you on set in Gangwon-do.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.356
No need to walk me out.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:22.680
LOVE IN WHITE

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.905
I just thought…
Maybe you didn't understand it.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.165
As you can see,
the writers' names are all different.

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:52.710
This one's mine,

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.547
so of course the script
is slightly different.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:58.632
So then…

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.927
why are these two the same in content
but have different writers?

SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:10.853
Please explain.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.902
There must be a reason
why you gave me those clues.

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.320
I need to know now.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:22.865
Why do you think

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.701
Director Lee Duyoung

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.662
stopped making films after <i>Love in White</i>?

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.832
I don't know.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.418
Maybe he got sick of it.

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:38.130
Or maybe a thread of guilt got to him.
I wouldn't know.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.219
I…

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:48.057
wasn't his mistress, as people say.

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:51.185
His muse?

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:54.230
Not that either.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.399
Will you

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.653
believe what I'm telling you?

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:05.366
Yes.

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.326
Please go ahead.

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:58.085
Mr. Lim, how do you feel
about going to work today?

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.629
Well, I don't know how to put it.

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.298
Nervous, I guess.

00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:07.344
Whoa.

00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:10.723
Oh.

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.474
I think that's the sea.

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:14.977
It's the sea!

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.274
It's beautiful.

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:24.612
It's the sea!

00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:28.616
Mr. Lee!

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.119
Mr. Lee!

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:34.163
Mr. Lee!

00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:35.998
Say hi to the camera!

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:38.250
Say hi!

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.714
Hi!

00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.174
- Daeum!
- Huh?

00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:51.597
<i>Say hi!</i>

00:23:52.222 --> 00:23:54.099
<i>Hi!</i>

00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:56.018
<i>Hi!</i>

00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:59.647
Only ten minutes left, Daeum.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.148
Exciting, isn't it?

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:03.233
Um, yes.

00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:07.112
I think I'm a bit nervous too.

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.739
Why do I feel more nervous now?

00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:10.741
I can't be jittery on set.

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:16.455
Actors are human too.
It's natural to be nervous. Oh.

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:18.832
Want some?

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.337
Did you take that many?

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.923
They were tasty, so I lost track.
How many did I take?

00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:28.258
Mr. Lim, I'll just

00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:31.053
- take two of these, okay?
- Okay.

00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.460
Hmm?

00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:05.796
What's he doing?

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.382
Why is he retying them? They looked fine.

00:25:16.223 --> 00:25:18.892
Okay! Cut!

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.604
The director in full freak-out mode.

00:25:22.688 --> 00:25:25.024
Can't believe I caught such a rare sight.

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:26.900
Ta-da!

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:32.489
Here you go.

00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:34.908
What's this?

00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:38.037
Your friend took four of those.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.413
One should be enough for…

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:41.707
No, maybe two.

00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:45.002
I'm fine.

00:25:45.586 --> 00:25:48.422
So were your laces,
but you redid them anyway.

00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.215
You're nervous, right?

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:04.104
Doesn't taste great.

00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:24.625
This is all I need.

00:26:27.002 --> 00:26:28.295
I was really nervous,

00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:30.297
but thanks to you,

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:32.174
I'll manage with meds.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.594
Now that…

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:39.306
we've caught each other being nervous,

00:26:40.224 --> 00:26:43.227
let's keep that between us.
No one else has to know.

00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:01.537
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:06.125
I wasn't sure back at that crew dinner,

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.793
but it's really you, Eunho.

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:11.296
Oh. Hey, Jaein. It's been a while.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.549
I heard you were working on films,

00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.135
so I figured we'd cross paths eventually.

00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:19.513
But I didn't expect it to be this set
with Lee Daeum as the lead.

00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:21.056
Me neither.

00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:23.851
So you didn't know either?

00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:25.978
Know what?

00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:28.605
Nothing.

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:32.150
Let's talk more next time, as alumni.

00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:46.957
HANKUK UNIVERSITY OF ARTS
THEATER &amp; FILM, TA OFFICE

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.293
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- How can I help you?

00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:51.753
My name is Noh Huitae. I'm from Npatch.

00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:53.839
Would you happen to know these people?

00:27:53.922 --> 00:27:56.675
They're graduates here.
Starting class of '19.

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.552
What's this about?

00:27:59.136 --> 00:28:01.471
Chasing a lead for an article.

00:28:01.555 --> 00:28:03.640
You're here!
Welcome!

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:05.934
You must be busy.

00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:07.394
Are you sure it's okay to be here?

00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:11.815
I invested about 6 billion won here,
so I should be busy here too.

00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:13.025
Oh, of course.

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:14.902
- Am I making you uncomfortable?
- Not at all.

00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.904
I'll be here until tomorrow.

00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:18.238
Until tomorrow, you say?

00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:19.323
Is that a problem?

00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:21.909
No, of course not. We're just grateful.

00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:23.660
I'm not here to spy on you,

00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:25.829
- so don't worry about that.
- Right.

00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:28.749
"This guy is clueless about films
and just invested in one."

00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:30.250
Pardon?

00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:33.503
- I don't want people to say that about me…
- Ah.

00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:35.505
…so I figured it's time to start learning.

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:38.508
Of course, Mr. Han.

00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:43.305
The light on this side is softer
so it needs some cleaning up.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.308
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.102
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.398
Let's put this in you.

00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:55.525
All right.

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:57.235
Did it go like this?

00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:00.072
The needle should

00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:01.740
go this way, like this.

00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.702
The IV line should be like this.

00:29:05.786 --> 00:29:07.663
Oh. Oh, of course.

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:09.498
Could you make the tape a bit longer?

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.583
Okay. Like this?

00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:14.544
Were you a nurse or something?

00:29:14.628 --> 00:29:19.591
Uh… Someone in my family used to be sick.

00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:21.176
- That's why I know this stuff.
- Ah.

00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:23.011
Thank you.

00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:28.225
You're here.

00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:31.561
Are you running lines together?
Good luck!

00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:35.691
Finally, it's our first day of shooting.

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:37.526
Must be cozy.

00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.362
What?

00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:42.114
Just lying there to act.

00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:45.701
You lie there,
frown a bit like you're in pain,

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.869
and a movie
with your name on it gets released.

00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:52.582
I don't know how this seems to you,

00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:54.793
but that's not the whole story.

00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:56.586
Sure.

00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:00.674
Let's get to know each other one by one.

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:04.678
Smile.

00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:06.179
From now on,

00:30:06.263 --> 00:30:08.390
we're the best of friends, you know?

00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:13.729
We were something
like friends once, weren't we?

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.650
Let's not do this, Jaein.

00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:21.445
See you later.

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.416
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:38.128
Never used blush
for a patient look before.

00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:42.340
But you're just so pale
that it looks fake if I don't use blush.

00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:51.433
How does it look?

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:56.229
- Good luck on your first shoot!
- Thank you!

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.455
Makeup looks good.

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.000
Mm-hmm.

00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:18.543 line:20%
LOVE IN WHITE

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:21.588
Do you remember Lee Gyuwon Bookstore?

00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:27.511
Gyuwon has lived

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:31.932
her whole life there
and treated it as her home.

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.600
Hmm.

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:37.938
Gyuwon is someone who treasures books,

00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:39.147
and that kind of person…

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:44.236
would treasure scripts too.

00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:49.741
Try to relax.

00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:51.993
Focus on this situation and your emotions.

00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:54.079
You can do it, right?

00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:56.748
Yes.

00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:08.612
Wow.

00:33:14.868 --> 00:33:16.036
I'm really in it now.

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:18.121
I'm in

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.207
this movie.

00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:45.440
<i>Even though I'm sick,</i>

00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:49.319
I can still watch movies,
go to auditions, and even love.

00:33:50.487 --> 00:33:52.155
<i>So I can make movies too.</i>

00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:57.244
I can do everything. I really can.

00:33:57.327 --> 00:33:59.162
Just let me prove that to you.

00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:05.418
All right, this is our first real take!

00:34:05.502 --> 00:34:07.212
Watch your footsteps, everyone!

00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:08.630
Let's begin shooting.

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.548
Camera rolling.

00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:12.300
<i>Love in White</i>, scene 1, shot 1, take 1.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.680
Ready…

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:29.734
Action!

00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:48.169
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:50.922
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:56.011
<i>If anything feels even a little off,</i>
<i>call me right away.</i>

00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:22.078
Cut.

00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:36.801
Hang on.

00:35:44.225 --> 00:35:47.812
That's some insanely realistic acting.

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:52.108
She actually looks like a real patient.

00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:55.945
You mean she's acting really well, right?

00:35:56.696 --> 00:35:57.697
Well,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.117
she's not actually
sick or anything, is she?

00:36:24.057 --> 00:36:25.725
Mr. Lee, how was I?

00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:30.563
You followed the script well, but…

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.359
Something feels missing.

00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:39.447
You don't have to stick
to the action lines that strictly.

00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:41.783
Gyuwon is

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:45.745
leaving to use her remaining time
for herself, not to give up.

00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:47.956
She feels she can

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.958
do anything even if she's sick.

00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:53.837
You know that feeling, right?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.963
I do.

00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:57.424
Better than anyone.

00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:00.927
The Lee Daeum I know
wouldn't have been just scared.

00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:03.263
You're right.

00:37:04.431 --> 00:37:08.143
I was bursting with excitement,

00:37:08.768 --> 00:37:09.811
but scared,

00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:14.607
and also a bit heartbroken
at the same time.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.446
Yes, that's it.
Just show that feeling to the camera.

00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:22.323
Okay.

00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:23.992
I'm ready.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.248
All right, let's try this again.

00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:33.126
Ready…

00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:35.170
Action!

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.976 line:20%
BECOMING THE COOLEST ACTRESS
IN THE WORLD

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:52.395 line:20%
TEST SHOOT

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:31.601
I'm leaving now.

00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:34.354
Thanks for everything.

00:38:50.453 --> 00:38:51.663
Cut! Okay.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.874
Good job, let's move on.

00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:59.462
That was great, Daeum.

00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:00.547
Thank you!

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.216
All right, let's move on
to the next location!

00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:05.134
Great work.

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:25.071
Great work!

00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:27.115
See you soon!

00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:30.743
Mr. Lee.

00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:33.705
Well done. It couldn't have been easy.

00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:38.543
And you did a great job.

00:39:39.294 --> 00:39:41.170
Did you just compliment me?

00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:43.506
Did I really do a good job?

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.175
Yes, you did. Don't get too excited.

00:39:46.259 --> 00:39:49.429
You know, I imagined this scene

00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:51.598
hundreds and thousands of times.

00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:54.726
And now that I'm actually
inside the world I pictured…

00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:58.771
it's incredible.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:02.609
Making a movie…

00:40:04.611 --> 00:40:05.904
it's a killer job.

00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:10.825
- Of all the ways to say it…
- No!

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.413
I just really love it!

00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:19.292
I'll see you later!

00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:23.504
Great work!

00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.715
- See you soon!
- See you soon.

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:27.926
- Great work!
- Great work.

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:36.976
Both the actress and the director
are really something.

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:40.730
I'll just head out now.

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:43.107
You're not going to watch more?

00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:45.401
From the looks of those two,

00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:48.071
the story will practically write itself.

00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:51.741
If you can just give things
a little push, Mr. Bu,

00:40:51.824 --> 00:40:53.493
it'll all be perfect.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.329
No need to worry about that.

00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:58.873
I'm a pro at lighting the match
at the right time.

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:02.502
Then I'll leave it to you.

00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:04.212
Yes, sir.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.844
Come preach
when you've dropped 10 billion.

00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:14.222
Where is that bastard?

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:17.600
Either call the cops
or throw him in a psych ward.

00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:19.227
Kick him out.

00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:21.980
No, I'll just go myself and--

00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:23.064
Father.

00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:26.484
You know,

00:41:27.402 --> 00:41:30.822
try to be more irritated from the start.

00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:32.991
And call me "Dad," not "Father."

00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:34.200
From the start?

00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:36.160
How should I do that?

00:41:36.953 --> 00:41:40.289
Are you usually all polite
to your own father at home?

00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:43.251
Just "Father" this, "Father" that,
and never snapping back?

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:46.879
I call him "Dad,"

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.798
I get snappy and even mean.

00:41:48.881 --> 00:41:49.924
Exactly.

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:53.219
And Gyuwon only has her dad.

00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:57.598
They love and cherish
and trust each other,

00:41:57.682 --> 00:42:00.727
which means
they can snap at each other too.

00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:04.355
He's not some weird guy!

00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:07.984
That's it.

00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:09.819
You got it right away.

00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:11.904
Let's go with that.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.161
Why are you crying?

00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:20.246
Oh?

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.290
Is it because of me?

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.419
Did you get scolded?

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:29.255
No, these are happy tears.

00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:30.506
Sorry?

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:33.051
Happy tears!

00:42:38.056 --> 00:42:39.057
All right, then.

00:42:40.308 --> 00:42:41.392
Let's start shooting.

00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:43.519
Okay!

00:42:45.772 --> 00:42:47.899
<i>If he wants to die that badly,</i>
<i>tell him I'll kill him myself!</i>

00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:50.109
<i>Just one month.</i>

00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:54.530
I'll turn him around by then.

00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:04.791
Cut! Okay. That's good.

00:43:04.874 --> 00:43:06.250
All good here!

00:43:06.334 --> 00:43:08.586
We've got an hour for lunch now.

00:43:08.669 --> 00:43:09.837
- Please go and eat!
- Enjoy!

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:11.923
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:43:13.716 --> 00:43:14.884
Mr. Lee!

00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:20.723
I have a lot of questions for you.
I'll grab us a spot over there!

00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:26.562
- Bon appétit.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:30.233
- Enjoy your meal.
- Chow down.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.986
Where are you going?

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:35.613
Uh…

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:37.990
Daeum's a friend of mine.

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:39.826
I'll go eat over there.

00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:48.042
The food here's better than most places.

00:43:49.335 --> 00:43:51.087
Oh. Yeah.

00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:58.136
You said you had questions?

00:43:58.219 --> 00:43:59.303
Oh…

00:43:59.387 --> 00:44:01.806
Yes, but why don't we eat first?
Take a seat.

00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:02.890
Hmm.

00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:07.478
Should I come back later?

00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:10.106
No, it's fine. Let's eat together.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.941
Okay.

00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:14.735
Enjoy your food. Enjoy.

00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:34.463
It's tea time.

00:44:35.298 --> 00:44:36.299
Thanks.

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:38.676
I thought you didn't drink instant coffee?

00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:41.721
This one's got protein in it,
so I heard it's good for you.

00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:43.514
Thank you for this.

00:44:44.015 --> 00:44:45.808
It smells nice.

00:44:49.228 --> 00:44:50.229
Ah.

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.570
Huh?

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.698
What's wrong with this?

00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:02.992
Let me take a look.

00:45:07.163 --> 00:45:08.164
Wow.

00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:10.583
I heard old camcorders are trendy again,

00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:12.585
but this thing's ancient.

00:45:12.668 --> 00:45:13.961
Hmm.

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.671
You drink your coffee, I'll take a look.

00:45:16.255 --> 00:45:17.256
Thanks.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.054
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:24.847
It's good, isn't it?

00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:28.017
Yes, it's good.

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.646
Is that what you wanted to ask me?

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:34.273
Come on, of course not.

00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:39.904
JUST EVEN BEING TOGETHER
MAKES ME HAPPY

00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:53.668
It's working fine again.

00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:56.254
Hmm?

00:45:56.337 --> 00:45:57.338
Thanks.

00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:00.007
Hey, Daeum?

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:03.010
After I'm done covering for this shoot,

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:06.055
I'm heading to Southeast Asia
for another one for about three months.

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:08.099
You'll be done filming by then too, right?

00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:10.726
Yeah. Why?

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.520
Can I call you more often then?

00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:14.563
Yeah.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:16.107
That's a promise, then.

00:46:16.816 --> 00:46:18.401
Okay.

00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:23.406
I'll get going. Thanks for the coffee.

00:46:36.085 --> 00:46:39.213
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:40.298
Mr. Kim.

00:46:41.173 --> 00:46:42.174
Yeah.

00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:44.677
- You must be cold.
- No, I'm fine.

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.556
That's warm.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.058
That's nice, thanks.

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:55.771
I heard you were the one
who found Lee Daeum.

00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:58.941
Yes, through an audition. We got lucky.

00:47:00.443 --> 00:47:03.612
Looks like you got
your father's eye for actors.

00:47:03.696 --> 00:47:04.864
Great job.

00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:09.535
What kind of person
was Kim Jinyeo?

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:12.955
Did you meet her?

00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:20.713
Hmm. Jinyeo asked me

00:47:21.464 --> 00:47:23.591
about you quite often.

00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:25.926
She wanted to meet you.

00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:27.887
Jinyeo…

00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:32.433
She wasn't the kind of person
who deserved to be judged

00:47:33.184 --> 00:47:35.144
so harshly by the world.

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.647
By any chance,

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:41.692
do you know anything about my mother?

00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:43.903
Not much, really.

00:47:44.653 --> 00:47:47.114
Your father never introduced her to me.

00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:53.162
But he did say this one time
while we were drinking,

00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:58.125
"Thank goodness Eunae is with me."

00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:03.130
Said that out of nowhere
while we were breaking down the script.

00:48:03.923 --> 00:48:05.508
That's why it stayed in my head.

00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:10.638
LOVE IN WHITE FIRST SHOOT,
BUFILM'S TREAT!

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:11.722
ENJOY, CAST AND CREW!

00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:13.182
These will go well together.

00:48:16.102 --> 00:48:17.186
Mr. Ji.

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.562
Did you have any fruit?

00:48:18.646 --> 00:48:20.064
No.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:22.024
- Uh…
- Goodness.

00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:23.442
Why, thank you.

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:31.909
You know, I'm not usually
that type of person,

00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:34.328
but I was a bit tipsy and got too excited.

00:48:34.412 --> 00:48:35.871
I'll get you a new one.

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:38.666
This one's my favorite.

00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:43.295
Give me your bank account number.

00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:46.549
Hang on a second.

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:50.803
Huh? My number's already…

00:48:53.222 --> 00:48:55.724
You're the DP.
Of course I have your number.

00:48:55.808 --> 00:48:58.227
Now, give me your account number
so I can reimburse you.

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:02.356
I actually don't mind it like this.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.859
It'll look bad on you
if you keep it like that.

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:06.277
Think of your status as the DP.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.116
Okay, then.
Let's go buy it on our off day.

00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:15.786
Off days are for our own breaks.

00:49:17.746 --> 00:49:19.081
Wait, he didn't have my number?

00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:30.551
Hello.
You're Ms. Gwak Gyoyeong, right?

00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:32.219
Who are you?

00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:35.306
I'm Noh Huitae, a reporter at Npatch.

00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:38.726
I'm not dangerous.
You're Lee Daeum's friend, right?

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:40.436
Why are you asking?

00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:42.521
I went by your place
and heard you worked here.

00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:44.440
Could I ask for a short interview?

00:49:45.983 --> 00:49:46.984
Hey, wait.

00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:49.320
- Hold on.
- Mom, did you open the door to a weirdo?

00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:51.739
From now on, ignore everyone!

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:53.407
Hang on, I'm not a weirdo.

00:49:53.491 --> 00:49:55.159
- I'm a reporter.
- No interview.

00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:56.785
I don't care what it's for.

00:49:56.869 --> 00:49:59.079
I won't answer anything you ask. Got it?

00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:01.457
- Wait, please.
- Don't follow me!

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.625
I will call the cops.

00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:11.634
GO HYEYOUNG,
BEYOND ENTERTAINMENT CEO

00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:17.014
It's as you said, Ms. Go.

00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:19.058
Everyone around her is very defensive.

00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:22.811
Her father's a doctor
at Hankuk National University Hospital.

00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:24.230
I'll look into that too.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:26.565
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:28.317
- Great work today!
- Well done today.

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.196
What are you doing after this film?

00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:33.948
Got another shoot lined up.

00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:36.534
It's all overseas,
so I'll be flying out right afterwards.

00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:39.495
Wow, I'm jealous. Can I take your place?

00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:42.581
Honestly, I'd rather switch with you
and stay here

00:50:42.665 --> 00:50:43.832
until this movie wraps.

00:50:47.127 --> 00:50:48.504
Hello, everyone!

00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:49.964
Say hello to the camera.

00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:51.632
Hi!

00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:55.594
I heard this is where all the fun is.

00:50:55.678 --> 00:50:57.054
Do you mind if I film this?

00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:58.389
Sure, anything you want.

00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:01.016
I love this kind of stuff.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.768
Behind-the-scenes vibes.

00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:06.272
It's okay if I post this, right?

00:51:06.355 --> 00:51:09.149
Yeah, sure. It'll be good promo, I guess.

00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:10.442
Okay.

00:51:10.526 --> 00:51:12.194
I have 300,000 followers after all.

00:51:13.362 --> 00:51:14.530
You know that, Eunho. Right?

00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:16.240
Oh? You're on a first-name basis?

00:51:16.323 --> 00:51:19.076
We went to college together.
Theater and Film at Hankuk Arts.

00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:20.327
Ah…

00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:21.954
And Daeum too.

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.623
You must've been very popular, Eunho.

00:51:24.707 --> 00:51:26.417
I wasn't popular at all.

00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:28.919
Daeum was the popular one, wasn't she?

00:51:29.795 --> 00:51:30.796
That's true.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.091
- She was popular then, she's popular now.
- Mmm.

00:51:34.842 --> 00:51:36.844
Now? Is there something going on with her?

00:51:42.558 --> 00:51:43.726
Oh, I get it.

00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:46.353
Do you mean

00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:49.064
Daeum and the director?

00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:51.483
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:53.652
- Let's have a drink.
- Sure.

00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:23.223
I'D LIKE TO TALK THROUGH
TOMORROW'S SCENE.

00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:24.975
ARE YOU UP FOR THAT?

00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:32.232
Hey! Ms. Yu!

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:36.236
Everyone's off drinking.
What are you doing here alone?

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.072
Just had a few things to wrap up.

00:52:38.614 --> 00:52:40.032
Alone, quietly.

00:52:40.115 --> 00:52:41.950
You never clock out, do you?

00:52:43.118 --> 00:52:45.162
You might want to head in soon, though.

00:52:45.245 --> 00:52:46.330
Why?

00:52:46.413 --> 00:52:48.248
I think it's going to rain soon.

00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:50.376
Oh? There's no rain in the forecast.

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:52.795
Look, not a cloud in the sky.

00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:01.679
Come on! No way!

00:53:02.638 --> 00:53:04.807
The weather service can't do me like this!

00:53:18.696 --> 00:53:21.407
Wait, how did you know?

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:22.533
Huh?

00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:23.701
The rain.

00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:26.704
Not even my paid weather app
saw this coming.

00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:27.788
How did you?

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.249
Whenever it's about to rain,

00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:33.085
the knee I messed up
back in my athlete days starts acting up.

00:53:33.627 --> 00:53:36.213
You'll be the first one I call

00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:38.215
the next time it does this.

00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:46.223
- Should we go in?
- Yes, let's go. Careful.

00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:48.100
It better not rain tomorrow.

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:50.102
- It won't rain tomorrow.
- How do you know?

00:53:50.185 --> 00:53:52.020
- I just have that feeling.
- What?

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.575
Hey, Hong. Do you know if this rain--

00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:06.326
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I heard it'll stop soon.</i>

00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:08.162
Is that so? That's good.

00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:12.082
Seoyoung and Jungwoo
are coming tomorrow, right?

00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:13.834
<i>Yes, they've got things today</i>

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:16.754
<i>so they'll come first thing</i>
<i>in the morning. Why?</i>

00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:18.130
No reason, just asking.

00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:22.009
I'll be on the 9th floor
talking to an actor.

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:23.802
If you need me, come find me there.

00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:25.596
Okay.

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.962
Did something happen
between you and Daeum?

00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:00.631
What do you mean?

00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:04.301
I saw you two on set earlier today.

00:55:04.927 --> 00:55:06.887
What, are costars not allowed to talk?

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.222
What about just now?

00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:11.892
You started going on
about how popular she is,

00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:14.520
and even brought up the director.

00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:16.855
You don't think that's weird?

00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:20.192
Why would it be weird
if there's nothing between them?

00:55:20.275 --> 00:55:22.402
No one's safe from gossip.

00:55:23.403 --> 00:55:25.656
Isn't it especially risky
for you or Daeum?

00:55:26.198 --> 00:55:29.368
You know very well
how fast rumors spread on set.

00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:30.494
You and Daeum

00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:32.704
used to be friends.

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:36.833
Friends?

00:55:38.043 --> 00:55:39.753
How do you know if they're just rumors?

00:55:40.712 --> 00:55:44.258
Nobody here knows
how Lee Daeum became the lead.

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:47.553
Stop pretending like you do.

00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:50.639
Do you still have feelings for her?

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.101
Yeah.

00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:56.520
I still have feelings for Daeum.

00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:59.898
So I'd appreciate it
if you treat her well.

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.609
I'm always the problem, aren't I?

00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:21.920
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:33.974
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.102
<i>Do you still have feelings for her?</i>

00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:38.854
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:40.856
<i>I still have feelings for Daeum.</i>

00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:43.984
<i>So I'd appreciate it</i>
<i>if you treat her well.</i>

00:56:46.987 --> 00:56:48.405
You really care about Daeum, huh?

00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:56.038
I just need her.

00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:57.164
That's all.

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.665
Is it you that likes her,

00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:00.500
or her that likes you?

00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:02.044
What are you talking about?

00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:03.670
Are you running out of article ideas?

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.797
<i>What about Lee Jeha as a person?</i>

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.967
Could you love someone
knowing how it ends?

00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:31.573
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:57:31.657 --> 00:57:33.659
I'D LIKE TO TALK THROUGH
TOMORROW'S SCENE.

00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:35.077
ARE YOU UP FOR THAT?

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:49.800
You don't even know
if it's life or death you don't want.

00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:53.261
Everyone dies in the end…

00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:01.436
Hi.

00:58:01.937 --> 00:58:03.605
Uh…

00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:05.065
Hello, Ms. Chae.

00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:08.694
Everyone's been raving
about how well you did today.

00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:12.739
I just got here, and this might be
our only chance to run lines.

00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:15.200
Mind if I come in for a bit?

00:58:17.285 --> 00:58:18.704
Sure. Come in.

00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:21.748
I see you were reading the script.

00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:24.918
Yes.

00:58:26.086 --> 00:58:27.504
What are these meds?

00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:28.839
They're nothing.

00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:31.216
Oh, it's a prop.

00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:35.470
Yes, I just put supplements in there.
You know, vitamins.

00:58:35.554 --> 00:58:36.638
Vitamins?

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.015
Then can I take one?

00:58:39.099 --> 00:58:40.225
No!

00:58:45.564 --> 00:58:48.775
How long were you in the hospital
that you don't know how the world works?

00:58:49.735 --> 00:58:51.278
You can't even lie properly.

00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:20.390
Are you all right?

00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:21.475
I said, are you okay?

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:25.270
Yes. I'm all right.

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.362
You…

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.407
Why are you here?

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.285
That's what I should ask you.

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:43.580
And what else?

00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:47.626
Isn't there more you want to ask?

00:59:48.627 --> 00:59:51.463
And if I ask,
can you give me a straight answer?

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.014
Look at each other, the two of you.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.436
Let's just lay it all out now.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.315
The first time
I asked Daeum to come rehearse,

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:12.526
she had a seizure and was screaming.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.069
I took her to the hospital.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:18.323
I waited at the ER,
and her doctor told me not to worry.

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:21.117
Didn't explain what was wrong.
Just told me to go home.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.036
Isn't that ridiculous?

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:25.288
When I was the one
who brought her to the hospital.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:28.416
- Uh, Ms. Chae, that's…
- Yeah.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.336
I put that behind me a while ago.
And then,

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.797
the next time we met,

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.675
you were in an elevator
wearing a stolen doctor's coat.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.344
A nurse was looking for you,

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:42.305
and I pretended to be your sister
to get you out of there.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:46.893
I brought you home with me,
then Mr. Lee came and took you back.

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:50.981
Now you really need to explain.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:52.899
Tell me why.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:56.862
What on earth is going on?

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.651
I probably have about four months now.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.737
Daeum.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:40.822
Four months?

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.916
I thought I could finish filming
within that time.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:54.502
No, I have to finish.

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:55.587
That's enough.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:57.964
I'll explain.

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:02.177
You asked if I'm really dying, right?

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.678
Yes,

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:04.888
I really am dying.

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:15.982
Ms. Chae…

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:19.819
I'm terminally ill.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:24.115
This isn't acting, it's not for show.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.285
I'm actually a dying terminal patient.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.092
<i>Can't you tell cheap pity from love?</i>

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:26.970
<i>How could you even think to fall in love</i>
<i>when you're dying?</i>

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:31.433
<i>You're seriously filming with a girl</i>
<i>who could die at any moment?</i>

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.185
<i>What if she really dies?</i>

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:36.563
That's why I needed Daeum.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.864
NOH HUITAE:
DID YOU KNOW THIS TOO, MR. BU?

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:48.450
Give me a moment.

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:50.744
<i>I really want to be in this movie.</i>

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:54.039
<i>I want to ask you</i>
<i>to pretend like you don't know.</i>

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.667
Let me be honest with you too, then.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.878
If you're only thinking about yourself,

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.713
then so will I.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.798 line:20%
