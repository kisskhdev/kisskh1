WEBVTT

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.500
Good morning.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.600
Big sis.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.700
You were amazing last night...

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.500
Amazing?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.800
And for me...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.300
That was the first time I've ever been that bold!

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.200
Bold?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.850
What do you mean by bold?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.200
Could it be...

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.000
I did that?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.000
Sorry! I got reckless for a moment...

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
You got reckless?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.200
So, how should I take responsibility for this...?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.000
Take responsibility?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This...

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.900
Could it be...

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.200
But I made sure to clean it thoroughly.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600
Hm?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.410
Ah! Right.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.700
After that, I went to another place, and it just so happened
that this kid ended up sitting right next to me.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.460
I'm really sorry.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.900
Even though I got dumped, I haven't gotten
that drunk and threw up in a really long time.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.300
Since I live nearby, I borrowed the washing machine,
and ended up falling asleep right away.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.300
That's not really a big deal.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.000
Um...

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.200
Nothing happened, right?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.800
Nothing happened...

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.200
What does that mean?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.320
A straight girl's reaction.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.800
That was close!

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.500
Got away with it!

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.400
Staying out overnight without letting anyone know.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.500
That's just terrible.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.500
Staying out overnight without telling your girlfriend
it's just unbelievable!!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.300
You really do only look at me
with those lecherous eyes, don't you?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.400
The only thing left to do is get down
on my knees and apologize!

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.800
You pervy, big-chested fiend! Goodbye!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.700
I'll have to show my utmost sincerity
and slide right in for a full-on kneeling apology...!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.200
Ayaka, I'm sorry!

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.400
Welcome back, Hiroko-san.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.500
You didn't get in touch at all,
I was really worried about you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.820
Um...

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.690
Last night I was out drinking, and before I knew it,
I was already at a friend's place.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.760
But honestly, nothing happened at all, so you can relax.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.700
Even though it might still be hard for you to believe,
I really didn't do anything.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.180
I can't take it anymore.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.260
No matter what you say, it just sounds like an excuse.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.700
I understand.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.800
But at the very least, you should let me know.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.950
Huh?

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.900
I have a meeting this morning, so I'm heading out now.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.900
Alright...

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.460
That's so strange.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.000
It's way too ordinary.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.800
If it were the usual Ayaka, she would definitely be really mad.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.500
Could it be...

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.800
Thank you.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.600
So cute!

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.400
Ayaka.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.200
Yes?

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.300
Be careful on your way.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600
I'm heading out.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.600
If you want to be together with her,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200
It's probably better not to stir things up.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.200
Why are you only coming back in the morning?

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.260
Who were you with?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.560
Why haven't you contacted me at all?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.500
Hiroko-san, you big-chested pervert! Idiot!

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.310
That finish line

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.500
isn't something you can decide on your own.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.600
If you want to stay together forever.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300
I have to become more mature.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.500
Do we really have to endure it?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.600
That answer...

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.200
It's up to you to decide.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.600
If we want to stay together, we have to be patient.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.400
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.800
(Episode 5: Shall we live together?)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Oh, right.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.200
I'll be home a bit late tonight.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.440
I see.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.600
Well then...

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.070
Got it.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.100
Stay safe, okay?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.500
Alright.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.700
Well then... good night, Hiroko-san.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.700
Good night, Ayaka.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800
That's right.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600
She said she had to work on the weekend today, right...?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.000
Back when I was still living alone,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.300
Breakfast used to be just like this, too.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.150
- Really?
- Yes.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.700
But that's actually pretty cute, too.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.600
Come to think of it, it all started with that date, didn't it?

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.500
Here you go, please enjoy.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.500
Wow! That's amazing!
It looks so fancy and absolutely delicious!

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.000
Nothing to brag about, really.
Some of it is just leftovers from breakfast.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.400
Do you really eat such a big meal first thing in the morning?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.300
I'm the kind of person who wakes up hungry in the morning.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.500
Ayaka, what do you usually have for breakfast every morning?

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.500
I usually just munch on toast or something like that.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.140
Huh? You just eat it plain?

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.800
Yeah, I just eat it plain like that.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.280
That's so Ayaka.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.600
So... from now on.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.200
Let's go try all kinds of different breakfasts together.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.600
Together?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.020
Are you talking about going to breakfast cafés and places like that?

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.300
I'll go with you!

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.060
No...

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600
That's not what I meant.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.500
Breakfast...

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.100
Would you like to have breakfast together?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.900
Every day, together.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.400
Does this mean…

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600
Ayaka.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.400
Would you like to live together with me?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.720
See, didn't you mention a while ago
that it's almost time to renew your lease?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.130
So... but... still, don't worry about it!

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.700
Ayaka, you still have your own plans and a lot to consider...

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.400
Even though I'm a bit clumsy,
I hope you'll look out for me from now on.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.900
For real?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.060
Is that okay?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.700
Yes!!

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.500
That's great!

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.230
I thought I was going to get turned down!

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.080
How could I ever say no to you?

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.500
I'm so happy.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.100
Your lips look so soft...

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.100
I really want to touch it.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.950
Is something wrong?

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.200
No, it's nothing. It just feels kind of new to me.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.300
I feel so shy.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.500
Um, Hiroko-san, can I borrow your makeup?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.610
Hey! Sure, why do you ask?

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.000
Because I want to do my makeup as cool as Hiroko-san does.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Sure!

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.200
Not sure if it'll suit you.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.800
By the way, Hiroko-san, what type of girls do you like?

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.930
Huh?

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.700
Last time we went shopping together.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.810
In the end, I still have no idea what kind of style you actually like.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.300
Please tell me.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.500
I want to become the type that Hiroko-san likes.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.800
Me?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.800
Whether it's sexy or cute

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.000
or cool...

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.500
Of course, there's also the off-shoulder look.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.300
As long as it's you, Ayaka, I love everything about you.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.560
Then today I'll wear a cool jacket.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.600
Pair it with a cute off-shoulder top
and a sexy skirt-pants combo on the bottom!

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.200
That would be kind of weird, wouldn't it?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.330
Then I want to try on Hiroko-san's clothes.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.500
Huh?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.800
Hiroko-san is so cute!

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.550
Oh no.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.200
- This is really bad.
- So cute!

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.190
You've worn something like this before?

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.800
That's right!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.640
Showing off so much shoulder, huh?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.880
Show a little more! Like this!

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.800
Hiroko-san, it's your turn for a shower...

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.100
That's pretty rare...

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.900
After all, you're usually so busy.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.600
I can't believe I get to see that kind of expression on Hiroko-san's face.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.800
Good night, Hiroko-san.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500
- Feels like a dream.
- Hm?

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.600
I can't believe I get to date Hiroko-senpai.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.000
Sorry.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.500
I made you wait so long before giving you an answer.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.400
No, I'm really glad I didn't give up!

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.960
Starting today, I can say that Hiroko-senpai is my girlfriend!

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.400
I'm really happy, but I'm still not quite used to it.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.000
You'll get used to it in no time.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.800
Thank you, Ayaka.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.000
You always believed in me and waited for me.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.300
Of course!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
From now on, no matter what happens,
I'll always like Hiroko-senpai.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.700
Please don't ever let go of this hand.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.100
Okay.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.700
I'm hungry!

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600
Come to think of it.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.100
For me being able to truly date a girl like this,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.000
Ayaka is the first one...

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.870
What is it.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.410
What's with that weird laugh?

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.500
I could never do things like this before.
Now, I've finally made it this far!

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.000
After all, we used to be boss and subordinate.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.300
But little things like this really make me happy.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.630
- I see.
- Yes!

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.700
- Then it's my turn next.
- I'm counting on you.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.000
When it's just the two of us at home,
we're not boss and subordinate anymore, right?

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.000
Can I... call you Hiroko-san?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.900
So it's still not okay after all?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.000
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.200
Ah... come on!

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.000
I think that's fine.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.600
From Hiroko-san's perspective.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:02.730
Huh?

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.130
So you've heard me!

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.300
- I can hear you, you know.
- Seriously.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.400
Hold on a second!

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.750
What did you just say?

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.130
Say that again?

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.600
It's Hiroko-san!

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.000
What did you say?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.500
- I can't hear you.
- Hiroko-san.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.440
I never knew.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.800
I can't hear you.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.800
- Hiroko-san~
- Having someone you love

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.300
to be this happy. It's unbelievable.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.200
Don't show my forehead!

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.280
Ah! Good morning.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.480
Good morning, you're drooling.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.200
- Hey, wait a sec!
- It's okay, you don't have to cover up.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.150
Because I must look like a total mess right now!

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.940
That's really cute.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.710
No way!

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.120
I haven't even washed my face yet.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.200
It's okay.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.400
Someone this adorable actually came into my life.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.400
It feels just like a dream.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.200
Hiroko-san?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.700
Is something wrong?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.400
No.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.900
It's nothing.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:31.100
Hiroko-san, I'm honestly so happy it almost scares me.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.300
Yeah, me too.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.000
I don't want you to be disappointed in me.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.200
It's just because of my selfish desires.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.600
It's almost done!

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.080
Alright!

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.200
I want her to feel completely satisfied,
without a single complaint...

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.000
Spotless cleaning...

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.800
Oh! Good morning.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.700
Did you help me clean up?

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.800
Thank you.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.000
To avoid making any mistakes,
I need to be extra careful and cautious.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.700
I hope I can become a girlfriend you can be proud of.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.100
It was delicious.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.200
Hiroko-san, you're truly perfect and amazing.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.430
I truly feel so happy.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.800
That's great!

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.100
I finished this one too.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.700
It's really delicious.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.700
Hiroko-san.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:43.800
Um...

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.300
Can I give you a goodbye kiss?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.000
So it's still not possible after all?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.800
I was just about to ask if it's okay.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.500
Of course you can!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.080
Take care on your way, Hiroko-san.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.350
This happiness...

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.020
I'm heading out.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.500
May it last a lifetime.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.900
It can't go on like this.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.900
I need to become even more perfect.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.000
Let's start over.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.700
What's this?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.600
So cute!

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.120
(To Hiro-chan: Thank you for coming to my wedding.
Your strength in speaking your mind, and your straightforward, honest personality...

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.700
has always helped me so much! Let's enjoy a nice,
relaxing meal together sometime. Thank you so much. With gratitude, Keiko.)

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.000
What I want to say...

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.760
It'll be done in no time.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.600
Okay.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.500
Is there anything I can help with?

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.600
It's okay, it'll be ready in no time.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.800
Hiroko-san is always...

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.400
Oh! Good morning.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.190
Did you clean up for me?

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.500
Thank you.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.070
No problem.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.500
You didn't say a word, but you did everything for me.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.650
Because you know it makes me happy.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.400
That's why you spoil me,

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.700
that's why you love me.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.500
You're trying so hard to become the ideal girlfriend I hoped for.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.000
Hiroko-san...

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.000
Have you been forcing yourself this whole time?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.200
It can't go on like this.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.800
Ayaka?

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.280
Ayaka...

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.200
(I would like to be alone for a while.
Please don't come looking for me.)

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.700
Hiro-chan! You weren't answering your phone,
so we just came over.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.280
I brought some souvenirs for you!

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.800
Hiro-chan!

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.220
Why does it have to be now...

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.900
(Next Episode)
Hiro-chan, do you like Ayaka?

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.740
Yeah.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.410
I like her.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.600
Absolutely love her!

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.350
Ayaka and I are in a relationship.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.000
Are you serious about being in a relationship?

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.200
Being with Ayaka truly makes me happy.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.600
I'm Hiroko's girlfriend, right?

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.340
Ayaka!

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.530
For Hiroko-san's sake, we shouldn't be together anymore.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.500
I'm sorry, I can't be your girlfriend anymore.
