This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.195
Don't let them get away.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.098
Find their scent.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.400
Coach!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.900
Coach Petch!
Dad!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.401
Run!

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.769
Take care of yourself.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.038
I'll take care of it.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.575
Everyone looks terrible.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.877
Give me the code.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:48.581
Otherwise, he’ll end up just like your father, Kanachit.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.117
Keen? Do you have the code?

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.118
No.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.053
What?
Mawin!

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.587
Then why the hell did you agree to give it to him?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.091
I know where we need to go.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.347
Thun!

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.756
Thun!

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.445
Bung!

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.847
Mai!

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.415
Mawin!

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.117
Ait!

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.996
Keen, watch out!

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.661
Thun!

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.097
Thun!

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.799
Thun, calm down.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.303
Thun!

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.740
Thun!

00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.979
No!

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.814
Thun!

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.635
Are you ok?

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.874
You can tell me.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.451
It's nothing.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.854
I just had a bad dream.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:23.403
Trap

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.929
Was I right not to tell everyone?

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.232
Everyone’s already risked so much because of me.

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.735
This whole thing started because of my family.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.305
Uncle Petch got captured because of me.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.874
I don’t want anyone else to get hurt because of me again.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:10.243
It’s about us, not just you.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.718
I have to take responsibility too.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.924
Let’s go save Uncle Petch together, just the two of us.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.537
Keen…

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:15.608
Are you sure about going there?

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.146
Yeah.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.621
And…

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.190
Does anything still hurt?

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.869
Thanks, Thun.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:54.113
Honestly, I’m still not sure.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:07:03.156
I just feel like if it were my dad, he would’ve hidden the code there.

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:06.352
Are you sure this is the place, Keen?

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.089
Mom…

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:49.395
I’m sorry I haven’t come to see you for so long.

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.900
Don’t worry about me.

00:08:56.135 --> 00:09:02.475
Right now, I’m trying to get justice for you and Dad.

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.150
Please help me.

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:18.357
Help me find what I’m looking for…

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:22.228
So no one else becomes a victim of Sia Thep like our family did.

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:52.058
This really is the place.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.807
Keen.

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:13.613
Keen, that’s enough.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.547
Thun…

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.248
No, Keen.

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.838
There’s nothing here.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.508
There's nothing.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.843
There has to be something.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:46.112
Keen, that’s enough.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.180
Dad must’ve left something with Mom.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.201
Keen.

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:10.403
Keen, look.

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:30.056
What’s are you drawing, son?

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:34.427
This is Dad, this is Mom, this is me, and this is our house.

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.962
Wow! What’s that in front of the house? So colorful.

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:38.564
Flowers!

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:41.767
When I grow up, I’ll plant red flowers in front of the house.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.303
So the front of our house will always be full of pretty flowers!

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:46.772
Hmm, that’s nice. I like it.

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:48.407
I think you should draw birds too.

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:50.309
Draw some more birds.
There should be flying birds.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:53.045
Green ones.

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:35.287
Everything… it all points back to your old house.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:42.561
I think we should go there.

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:44.797
I’m just worried Sia Thep’s men will be waiting.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:50.569
I think it’s better if I go alone.

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:55.741
Once I know it’s safe, I’ll tell you to follow.

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:59.979
Do you even hear what you’re saying, Thun?

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.450
I’m sorry.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.453
I’m just so worried about you, I lost sight of everything else.

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.532
I understand, Thun.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:22.134
But we talked about this already, didn’t we?

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.208
Wherever we go, we go together.

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.217
I’m worried about you too.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:45.057
Right now, you’re all I have left.

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:25.097
You’re here, Pakorn?

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:29.268
Did you get Keen and Thun?

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:32.905
Apologies, sir.

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:35.574
Our people are still out searching,

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:39.745
but we haven’t found them.

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.585
Jonathan must be hungry.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.421
Could you feed him?

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:21.587
Pour it in the bowl, please.

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:48.180
Pakorn, I’ve been thinking…

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.984
Keen and Thun’s escape..

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:57.489
It smells like there was betrayal, don’t you think?

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:01.527
Who do you suspect, sir?

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:02.995
I’m not sure.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:09.268
But everyone around me has reason to betray me.

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:13.605
Especially you.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.377
Pakorn.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.983
I really don’t want it to be you.

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:31.623
But I’m the one who delivered Thun to you.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:36.495
Exactly, that’s what’s strange.

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:43.068
Over a decade ago, you did everything

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:45.938
to keep Thun from becoming my fighter.

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:49.475
You even went so far as to find that boy Yut to replace him.

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:55.180
So why the change of heart now?

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:03.288
After years working for you,

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:10.129
I’ve come to understand one thing. When you want something, you get it.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:12.131
Good answer.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.038
Then I’ll give you a chance to prove yourself.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.873
And if you fail,

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:23.842
you know what will happen.

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:34.553
I’ll follow your orders, no matter what.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:37.923
About the Heaven Arena event.

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:43.562
I want you to oversee it from the ground up.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:47.299
But now, I’ve got one more mission for you.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:52.471
I’m not sure if Keen is playing any tricks.

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:56.208
I want you to prepare a backup plan.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:18:02.014
Catch Thun and Keen and get me the code.

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.319
Understood.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:10.122
Very good.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:16.962
But… who’s Typhoon’s opponent?

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:35.481
(Bank Property – No Trespassing)
(Violators will be prosecuted under criminal law. If you see anything suspicious, please notify the bank 24/7.)

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:38.917
(Property for Sale)

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.343
Are you serious, Keen?

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:05.110
Yeah.

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.787
Let’s go.

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.765
Let’s go look.

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:06.665
Did you find anything, Keen?

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.868
Nothing.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.023
Thun, do you think we’re even looking in the right place?

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:33.025
We have to be.

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:36.328
Trust yourself, Keen.

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:38.964
But we’ve been looking for so long

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.435
and still haven’t found anything that looks like a 24-word English code.

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:48.206
If it were that easy, anyone could’ve found it.

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:54.446
Your dad must’ve believed only you could uncover it.

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:29.047
The answer we’re looking for might be simpler than we think.

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:31.049
If we open our hearts.

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:36.221
Sometimes the answer is easier than we think.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.396
There’s no riddle that can’t be solved.

00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:48.533
Sometimes the answer is easier than we think..

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.302
If we open our hearts.

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.938
If we open our hearts.

00:22:58.744 --> 00:22:59.811
Yeah.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.581
But… how do we open our hearts?

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:19.498
Heart…

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:27.572
“Keen, don’t draw there.

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:30.142
Come draw at the table instead.”

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:32.511
“Sorry.”

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:36.848
“Look what you’ve done, my sofa’s all dirty now!”

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:40.452
Thun, get up.

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:41.787
Come on.

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:42.954
Hurry.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.597
Heart…

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:56.668
Open heart.

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:02.407
Open.

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.658
To Keen

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:12.444
Wait… is this…

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.841
Please…

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.811
remember…

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:50.248
Dad…

00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:54.085
Mom…

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:56.454
truly…

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:59.391
love…

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:02.928
Keen…

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.168
Could this be…

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:17.969
“I hope you’re okay. I’m sorry…

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:28.380
I believe this is the only way I can fix the mistake I made.

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:38.156
I hope you can smile again

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:43.628
and live a happy life.

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:54.839
Always remember that your mom and I love you very much, Keen.

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:58.376
We’re proud of you.”

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:36.347
Whoa!

00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:38.349
The code really was here!

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:40.652
Haha!

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:46.991
Hand over the code, and nobody gets hurt.

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:54.532
You want a bullet in your mouth or something?

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.588
Keen, watch out!

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:18.823
Keen! Watch out!

00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:00.165
Hey! Shit!

00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:08.840
Enough!

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.276
Give me the code.

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:14.279
Or he dies. Now!

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:25.190
Try me, if you touch my friend,

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.192
I’ll burn this code right now.

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:33.097
This code is worth a lot to your boss, right?

00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:38.303
Think about what Sia Thep would do

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:40.505
to a lackey who screws up and loses it.

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.106
Put the gun down.

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:44.275
Why the hell should I trust you?

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:47.846
I could just kill him and take the code from you after.

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.347
Don’t!

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:52.951
Fine, if you think you’re faster than me, then try it.

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.224
Argh! Damn it!

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:17.375
Hey!

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:43.034
Hey, are you okay?

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:45.036
No…

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:54.846
You alright?

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.848
I’m okay.

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:09.994
Let me patch that up for you.

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.597
Wow..

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:19.437
Hold on.

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.343
Does it hurt really badly?

00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:26.444
Yeah.

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:27.111
It hurts?

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.046
Yeah.

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:36.587
But it’s fine, at least my head finally came in handy for something.

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:37.789
So your head’s finally useful, huh?

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:38.356
Exactly.

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:39.891
Very funny.

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.193
Geez, I was just worried about you.

00:32:42.193 --> 00:32:43.861
Still not letting up, huh?

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:44.729
What now?

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:47.765
That’s enough.

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.767
I was worried about you!

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:52.670
Thank you.

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:56.541
No problem.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:00.678
Besides helping you guys, I did it to help my dad, too.

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:49.794
Hello, Pakorn.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.899
I have something important to tell you.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:34:00.605
About Heaven Arena, the place where Keen will exchange the code for Coach Petch.

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:02.607
Why?

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:07.078
Run away, it's a trap.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.618
A trap?

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.753
What do you mean?

00:34:15.753 --> 00:34:18.890
Whether you have the code or not.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.793
Sia Thep will never let you two go.

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:24.695
He’s already ordered his men to capture you.

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:26.697
But there’ll be tons of people at the event.

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:29.567
Haven’t you seen what Sia Thep is capable of?

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:32.470
Is there anything he wouldn’t do?

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.909
But we’re going to save my dad.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.745
If you go, everyone will end up dead.

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:43.214
Are you saying we should just let my dad die alone?

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:44.348
Bro…

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:48.986
Coward!

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.765
Um…

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:38.669
Thun, as your father…

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:41.205
Stop calling yourself my father!

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:52.817
What are you waiting for?

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:55.353
Gonna stall another ten years?

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:07.165
I’m sorry I was never a good father.

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:28.386
I want to hear it from you.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.388
Why did you leave me?

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:40.464
Ten years ago, when you were still a kid,

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:46.103
Phuwish came to see you box and was impressed with your skills.

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:49.473
He wanted you as a fighter in his private ring.

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:54.545
But I made a deal, I told him I’d follow all his orders

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:58.216
if he let you go.

00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:01.586
I didn’t want you ending up like the boxers in his camp.

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:06.557
So you protected me… by breaking the law?

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.025
Yes.

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:12.563
I did everything I could to protect our family.

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:15.600
Then you really are a coward, just like I thought.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.903
I risked my life to protect you,

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.972
and you call me a coward?

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:25.943
What you should have done was stand up to Sia Thep.

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:36.854
Please.

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:40.291
You don’t have to forgive me yet,

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:44.895
but tell me what I have to do for you to believe in me.

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:47.131
Don’t go to that match.

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:52.637
I have to, I need to save Coach Petch.

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:53.904
But Thun, it's...

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:58.709
If you’re really willing to do anything to protect me,

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:02.246
then help me take Sia Thep down.

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:12.523
Prove to me you’re not a coward.

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:02.907
Come on.

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.810
I’ve prepared everything, sir.

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.914
This way, please.

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:37.575
Sia Thep’s men are everywhere.

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:46.751
It’s just like Pakorn said.

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:48.152
They’re all over the place.

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:56.927
The main match is probably about to start.

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:58.929
Ok, let's wait.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.767
Get ready, guys.

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.700
Hey, Poppy.

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:43.607
Thun “Tiger-Taming Cannon,” what are you doing here?

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.283
I’m sorry, Poppy.

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:56.020
Sorry for what?

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:02.827
Hey, don’t!

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:04.562
Let me go!

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:05.162
I'm going on the ring soon!

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.163
Let me go!

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.832
Let me go, damn it!

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.268
Ow!

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:12.336
Let go!

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:14.672
Why are you tying me up?!

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:15.272
Let me go!

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:16.640
Calm down, Poppy. Just be quiet.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.742
Let me out, I’m supposed to fight!

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:19.643
Let me go!

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:20.644
I’m sorry, Poppy.

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.645
Let me go!

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:22.379
I’m really sorry.

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:23.447
Hurry.

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:28.052
Let me go, quick!

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:36.026
It’s almost time for the main event. I wonder where's Keen and Thun?

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:58.776
Good evening once again, ladies and gentlemen!

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:04.748
Welcome to Tiger Boxing World Stadium!

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:10.754
Woohoo!
Yeahhh!

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:13.557
After enjoying three thrilling fights,

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:17.995
we now arrive at the moment you’ve all been waiting for.

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:24.368
Our main event!

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.637
As you all already know,

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:35.012
this is gonna be exciting.
In the red corner, we have Typhoon “Roaring Thunder” from my own camp, P. White Tiger!

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:39.817
Yeah!
Woohoo!

00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:47.091
And in the blue corner, a Thai boxer who’s made a name on the global stage!

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:51.028
Poppy “The Savage Crusher” from the IBF!

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:55.065
Ohhh!
Woohoo!

00:43:55.065 --> 00:44:01.905
But… we have a little surprise for you today.

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:05.776
A last-minute switch just for our honored audience—

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:10.648
The main event is now a revenge match lightning round!

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:16.887
In the red corner: Typhoon “Roaring Thunder”!

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:20.224
And in the blue corner:

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:43.747
Thun “Tiger-Taming Cannon”!

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:51.855
Woo!
Yay!

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.257
Fuck!

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:57.861
Pakorn, you traitor!!

00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:02.166
Woo!

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:54.918
Let me just say this.

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:56.420
I didn’t take any drugs today.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.422
I want to fight you fair and square.

00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.623
Let’s settle this once and for all.

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:01.625
I want that too.

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:02.826
Secure Coach Petch.

00:46:02.826 --> 00:46:04.495
We need to get out of here now.

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:06.497
Capture everyone from the Petchsak Academy!

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:08.065
Especially Keen.

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.701
At first, I thought your dad was trying to be a hero.

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:12.503
But no…

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:16.340
He came to get revenge for your mom, after we scammed her out of all her money

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.276
and she got so stressed that she had a brain aneurysm…

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.310
You bastard!

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.879
Keen!
