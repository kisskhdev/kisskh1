WEBVTT

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.600
The company wants me to sign
an endorsement deal with Qingmu.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.640
Qingmu is just a
second-rate, small company.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.520
What right do they have to work with me?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.519
President Zhang, is this
about the endorsement fee?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.855
No matter how much they offer,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:24.879
I won't sign it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What endorsement fee?

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.559
It's your honor to work with Qingmu.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.800
It's also an honor for our Miracle Media.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.415
We'll sign this contract right away.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.536
As for the endorsement fee,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.335
we don't want a single cent.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:35.359
It must be free.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.600
Free? President Zhang, are you crazy?

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:39.520
I don't agree.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.375
This will affect my
reputation as Best Actress.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.399
Shut up.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:43.960
This is the company's decision.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.616
It's not your place to comment.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.816
Let me remind you,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.936
you're a popular star because
the company made you one.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720
The contract is also in
the company's hands.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.679
Miracle Media can make you famous,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.640
but we can also make
you disappear overnight.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.455
But why is this happening?

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:58.616
I need an explanation.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.015
You're not qualified to know.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.320
All you need to know

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.936
is that if you don't sign this contract,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.560
not only will the company blacklist you,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.320
but you'll have no place in the
entertainment industry from now on.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.439
Sign it now.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.120
Hurry up.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.680
President Su.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.440
Please keep this contract safe.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.280
You can order Xiao Yaqi
around however you like.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.896
If you have any other
requests, just let us know.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.656
Miracle Media will absolutely,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.320
fully cooperate with you unconditionally.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.959
Thank you, President Zhang.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.280
So, who's the clown now?

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.439
You.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.816
We didn't spend a single cent.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.920
We actually managed to sign Xiao Yaqi.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.959
Is this just another coincidence?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.280
No.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.319
I don't believe it.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:59.816
This can't be a coincidence.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.079
It can't be luck either.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.080
And it definitely isn't because
Chu Jiangchao is just a nice guy.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.280
Tell me, what's really going on?

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.599
Do you want the truth or a lie?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.280
Of course I want the truth.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.039
You wouldn't believe the truth anyway.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.679
Then tell me a lie, let's hear it.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.319
The lie is, I have a friend
who's good at voice imitation.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.936
I asked him to imitate
Chu Jiangchao's voice.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.240
He called the boss of Miracle.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.839
And fooled him just like that.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.695
That boss has been in business for decades.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.400
How could he be fooled so easily by you?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.560
If you walk by the river often,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.816
how can you not get your shoes wet?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.936
It wasn't just the boss of Miracle.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.575
Even Zhou Pengfei from Tiange Group

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.656
was fooled by me the same way.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.599
Enough, tell the truth.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.919
The truth is, Chu
Jiangchao is my underling.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.895
I just make a call,

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:48.455
tell him to do something,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.479
and he does it.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.817
That "truth" of yours

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.015
is even less believable than the lie.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.056
See, I told you.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.400
You'd never believe the truth.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360
You know,

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.295
if you'd told me this before,

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.199
I definitely would've
thought you were joking.

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.319
But now...

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.639
What's going on now?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.759
Do you believe it now?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360
I don't know.

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.360
I just feel like I understand
you less and less.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.759
I always feel like you
have a lot of secrets.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.680
You're just an ordinary delivery guy.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.159
But you can do so many incredible things.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.080
You're like a bottomless pit.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.800
The more people want to figure you out,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.280
the deeper they fall in.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.240
There's nothing I can do.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.800
Maybe that's a man's charm.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.960
Honey, don't tell me

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.240
you've really fallen for me?

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.479
Who—who likes you?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.336
We're just contract spouses.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.720
I don't have any feelings for you.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.216
Then just now, you

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.440
I didn't do anything just now!

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.919
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.120
You're going to sleep again?

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.439
Don't overthink it. You're
just contract spouses.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.240
Right.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480
Contract spouses.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.016
Just a second-tier celebrity,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.680
actually caught Mr. Gao's attention.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.879
He even specifically asked
her to be the spokesperson.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.279
Could it be

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.519
that Mr. Gao is interested in her?

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:45.696
Have Director Zhang Yimu start preparing
an international blockbuster immediately.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.600
Xiao Yaqi must play the female lead.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.439
I want, in the shortest time possible,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.279
to make her an international superstar.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.759
Also, spread the word.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.536
Tell those who have bad
intentions toward Xiao Yaqi

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.399
to stay far away.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.456
Anyone who dares touch a hair on her head

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.255
will be going against me, Chu Jiangchao.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.919
They'll bear the consequences themselves.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:06.920
Bastard.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.720
Why should I be a spokesperson
for Su Qingyan's lousy company?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.880
Do I, Xiao Yaqi, not
care about my reputation?

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.800
Well said.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:18.959
Who are you?

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.160
This is a private club.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.017
Get out.

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:22.696
Miss Xiao, there's no need to be afraid.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.480
We're all in the same boat.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.199
Let me introduce myself.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.399
I'm Song Haoyang.

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:32.079
I came here today specifically to
discuss a collaboration with Miss Xiao.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.560
So you're the young master of
the Song family from Yun City.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:39.720
What did Young Master Song
mean by what he just said?

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.879
My meaning is very simple.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:44.959
Miss Xiao, don't you dislike Qingmu Group?

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.199
That's perfect.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.720
I also have a grudge against Qingmu.

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.519
Why don't we join forces
to teach Qingmu a lesson?

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.879
A lesson? How?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.680
I heard that.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.279
Qingmu Group signed an
endorsement contract with you, Miss Xiao.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.279
They're about to hold a press conference.

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:08.000
As long as you publicly break the
contract at the press conference,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.279
and turn against them,

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:12.495
then with the media my Song family
has arranged to spread the news,

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:13.720
I guarantee.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.120
Qingmu Group will be utterly ruined.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.879
You think I don't want to?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.240
My contract is in Miracle's hands.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.880
If I dare to break the contract,

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.000
the company will immediately blacklist me.

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.096
Who will take responsibility
for the consequences?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.319
Will it be your Song family?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.240
Miss Xiao, you're overthinking it.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.079
My Song family can't do it,

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:35.720
but someone else can.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120
Who?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.439
Chu Jiangchao, the head
of Zhongyu Entertainment.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.560
President Chu.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:46.399
He's the godfather of
the entertainment industry.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.457
He has abundant resources.

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.279
He can make someone famous with ease.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.920
I'm just a second-tier minor celebrity.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.759
How could I possibly be
connected to such a big shot?

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.079
Maybe others can't,

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:59.279
but you definitely can, Miss Xiao.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.639
What do you mean by that?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.240
Miss Xiao, you probably don't know yet.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.415
President Chu personally made a statement.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.279
He warned the entire
entertainment industry.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560
No matter who it is,

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:11.079
no one is allowed to lay a finger on you.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.639
Otherwise, they're going
against Chu Jiangchao.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:17.000
Think carefully about what that means.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.800
This shows that.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.079
President Chu has taken a liking to you.

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:24.959
And he considers you
his forbidden treasure.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.759
President Chu likes me?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.199
Is that true?

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:31.456
Could there be a mistake?

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.600
Of course it's true.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.199
And I've even heard some rumors.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.055
President Chu has
arranged for a famous director

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:40.680
to create an international
blockbuster tailored just for you.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.920
As the female lead.

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.680
It has to be you.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.240
There's actually such a good thing?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.040
Hello?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.319
Miss Xiao, this is Zhang Yimu.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.319
I'm about to start preparing
for an international blockbuster.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.456
I'd like to invite you to
be the leading actress.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.600
I wonder if you have time in your schedule?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.935
Yes, yes, I do.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:07.879
Of course I do.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.000
It just so happens I'm filming in Yuncheng.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.800
Let's set up a time to meet later.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.336
We can discuss the script.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.136
Great, thank you, Director.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.240
Thank you, Director.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.480
Zhang Yimu is an
internationally renowned director.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.160
All the leading actresses he's promoted
have become international award winners.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.800
That's wonderful!

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.680
I finally don't have to worry about
the company's attitude anymore.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.720
Of course.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.000
Not just the company,

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.120
Don't forget,

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:37.600
you're now Chu Jiangchao's woman.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.320
You can walk anywhere in the
entertainment industry with confidence.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.097
How does that feel?

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:44.799
Feeling more confident now?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.120
Of course.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:50.600
I promise at tomorrow's press conference,

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:53.535
I'll definitely give Su
Qingyan and Gao Xing

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:55.200
a big surprise.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:01.440
Then let's have a great collaboration.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:03.599
Looking forward to working together.

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:08.576
How's the scene?

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
Is everything ready?

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.039
Don't worry, Mr. Su.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.679
Almost all the news media
in Yuncheng are here.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.056
Miss Xiao is backstage.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.456
She'll make the announcement herself soon.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.135
She'll officially sign with our Qingmu.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.639
Alright, keep a close eye on things.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.255
Make sure there are absolutely no mistakes.

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.279
Yes.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.000
That's great.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.960
As long as Xiao Yaqi announces the signing,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.855
our product can be launched smoothly.

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:28.879
It'll be a big hit.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.279
I'm still a little worried.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.039
Don't overthink it.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.240
The only trouble now is Xiao Yaqi.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.320
Her contract is still in Miracle's hands.

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:39.576
As long as she doesn't
dare offend her agency,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.519
and doesn't want to be blacklisted,

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:42.240
she'll definitely have to do as we say.

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:45.576
Next, let's welcome the
popular star Xiao Yaqi.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.279
Miss Xiao, please come to the stage.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.615
It's really her!

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:49.376
She looks amazing.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.535
Wow, Xiao Yaqi is so beautiful.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.559
Yeah.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.577
Take pictures, quick!

00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:54.799
Hurry up!

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.135
Wow, she's stunning.

00:09:57.159 --> 00:09:58.159
Yeah.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:01.919
Hurry, take a picture!

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:04.399
So beautiful, so lovely.

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.599
Here she comes, she's about
to make an announcement.

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.639
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Yaqi.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:12.936
I have an announcement.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.855
Because the new product from Qingmu Group

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:16.679
has serious quality issues,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120
effective immediately,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.240
I, Xiao Yaqi, am officially terminating
my contract with Qingmu Group

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:23.600
and will no longer serve
as their spokesperson.
