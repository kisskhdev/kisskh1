(For dramatic purposes, this episode
contains provocative scenes and settings.)

00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:04.264
Tell me where Mom is.

00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:05.999
Tell me!

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:07.033
So Mi, calm down.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:09.469
Tell me.

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.670
You can't kill him!

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:13.139
That scared me.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.908
That crazy So Mi.

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:19.846
Do you want to live?

00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:22.682
Yes.

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:23.917
You'll wish you were dead.

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:26.653
You're going to regret this.

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:30.624
That startled me.

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:32.492
Buchon-dong One.

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:36.129
They're swarming in right away.
That psycho.

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:37.764
Once again,

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:47.007
this is Bluebird One. Code Zero declared
at the jurisdictional precinct.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:48.842
Confirm Han Cheol Soo's residence.

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.577
Bluebird Two, on the move.

00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:51.912
Bluebird?

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:04.224
I found it.

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:07.227
Ah Hyun.

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:08.562
Can you hear me?

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:10.263
Get out of there now. Hurry.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.565
Okay.

00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:16.603
We don't have time, we have to go.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:18.104
Tell me where the hospital is.

00:01:19.506 --> 00:01:20.540
Daejeong Hospital.

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:22.609
It's not far from here, it's close.

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:25.779
I visit her often and call her a lot.

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:27.247
It's true, I swear.

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:29.749
Then what about this card?

00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:31.418
Who made this card?

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:33.520
What on earth is this card for?

00:01:34.354 --> 00:01:36.256
I don't know.

00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:37.490
I really don't know.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.558
Even if I did, I wouldn't know.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.861
If I talk, they'll kill me.

00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:42.996
They'll really kill me.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:44.798
Hey, you bitch.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:47.834
Then die.

00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:49.236
Ah Hyun.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:50.870
I said get out of there.

00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:54.007
Ah Hyun.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:56.176
Let's go.

00:01:56.176 --> 00:01:58.178
We have to go. Hurry.

00:01:58.178 --> 00:01:59.045
Go.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.380
Shit.

00:02:11.524 --> 00:02:12.359
Sorry.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.261
I said I'm sorry.

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.363
I'm screwed.

00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:20.033
Damn it.

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:32.812
What are you doing, you idiot?

00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:35.315
Aren't you going to untie me?

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.286
You can't even kill a single brat.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.861
- Don't move, you bastard.
- It hurts, do it gently.

00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:48.662
Stay still.

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.936
Ju An, are you okay?

00:02:57.203 --> 00:02:59.406
Untie me now, you bastards.

00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:18.959
Say that again.

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:21.161
What did you say?

00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:24.364
- Discarded items found.
- Follow me!

00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:45.885
Shit.

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.454
Bluebird Two, discarded items gone.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:48.555
Requesting search support.

00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:15.916
Seok Su!

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.288
Get them!

00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:31.231
Get them!

00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:52.819
Ju An.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:53.720
Darn it.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.728
Damn it.

00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:34.895
Are you okay?

00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:36.863
Requesting ambulance support.

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:38.598
Requesting ambulance support.

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:40.267
Are you alright?

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:42.335
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:43.236
Excuse me.

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:08.194
There were more survivors.

00:06:08.628 --> 00:06:10.830
It seems they had been hiding
in the demolition zone.

00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:12.933
We're checking...

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:16.303
if there was another accomplice
besides Woo Tae Sik.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.138
You must've seen her face, then.

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:19.339
Sorry?

00:06:20.907 --> 00:06:21.975
I mean Ah Hyun.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.478
She must be...

00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:28.582
well over twenty by now.

00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:31.885
So she really was alive?

00:06:33.453 --> 00:06:34.421
I'm sorry.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.725
Bring her back alive.

00:06:39.726 --> 00:06:41.695
Let's at least see
what she looks like now.

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.564
I wonder if she looks like me.

00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:46.366
Understood.

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:48.535
How many kids did you say there were?

00:06:49.102 --> 00:06:51.738
Five in total, including Choi Si Woo.

00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:54.007
Kwon Sung Woo.

00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:56.977
He was Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man's son,
right?

00:06:57.677 --> 00:06:58.545
Yes.

00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.294
(The Defects)
(Episode 3. The Survivors)

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:34.114
Are we living here now?

00:07:37.317 --> 00:07:38.351
Just for a while.

00:07:38.952 --> 00:07:40.220
We came back here again.

00:08:11.217 --> 00:08:12.252
Sorry.

00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:15.722
This is the best I could manage.

00:08:15.722 --> 00:08:17.958
Don't be sorry. Why would you be sorry?

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.093
This place is way bigger.

00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:22.862
This is a loft.

00:08:22.862 --> 00:08:24.097
It's a loft.

00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:27.033
Yes, I like it here too.

00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:28.168
I like it too.

00:08:28.602 --> 00:08:30.870
See, everyone likes it. Don't be sorry.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.073
We can make it nicer ourselves.

00:08:33.707 --> 00:08:34.541
Right.

00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:36.643
Let's look around.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.245
Okay.

00:08:50.257 --> 00:08:51.124
Watch your step.

00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:52.893
Careful.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.864
I'll move this.

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:01.401
There.

00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:04.004
This is our room, Ah Hyun.

00:09:07.574 --> 00:09:08.508
This is my room.

00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:12.112
This is our room.

00:09:12.112 --> 00:09:13.847
And this is our room.

00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:18.285
Ah Hyun, come here.

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:23.690
This is nice.

00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:29.362
Nice.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.871
Come here, Ju An.

00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:39.839
No, I like being alone.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.027
Aren't you going to sleep?

00:10:04.264 --> 00:10:05.131
Ah Hyun.

00:10:07.634 --> 00:10:09.469
What were your parents like?

00:10:17.777 --> 00:10:19.412
Among the parents who abandoned us,

00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:23.650
maybe there's at least one decent person.

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:27.787
Like So Mi's mom.

00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:33.660
I, too,

00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:37.330
had a mom.

00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:40.901
A woman who wanted...

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.105
to shine more than anyone.

00:10:46.973 --> 00:10:48.441
(Do everything in love.)

00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:49.409
(1 Corinthians 16:14)

00:10:55.482 --> 00:10:56.549
Come in.

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.355
You should come golfing with me sometime.

00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:05.292
It's not a good look for a pastor...

00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:06.359
to be hanging around the golf course.

00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:08.628
That's why I go...

00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:10.864
when it's closed, very secretly.

00:11:10.864 --> 00:11:11.798
I see.

00:11:12.732 --> 00:11:15.702
So, did you have a good talk?

00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:18.738
Just as I heard, she was very sincere.

00:11:18.738 --> 00:11:19.839
Very desperate too.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.541
That man is...

00:11:23.577 --> 00:11:25.145
perfect...

00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:28.982
without me.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.652
Because I can't have children.

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:40.860
Don't say that.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.696
You came all this way to find me.

00:11:51.771 --> 00:11:54.574
I want to give him a child that suits him.

00:11:56.309 --> 00:11:57.677
A perfect child.

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:04.985
That's wonderful.

00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:07.153
It looks like
your wish will come true soon.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.688
Your role is huge in this, Pastor.

00:12:09.222 --> 00:12:11.958
She respects and follows you so deeply.

00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.093
No.

00:12:14.094 --> 00:12:16.263
I make a living by talking, that's why.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.598
The Lord might get jealous.

00:12:18.598 --> 00:12:19.766
Is that so?

00:12:20.767 --> 00:12:23.136
But that too is a talent He gave me.

00:12:23.136 --> 00:12:24.204
I see.

00:12:25.572 --> 00:12:27.807
I'm thinking of making another offering.

00:12:29.376 --> 00:12:32.512
I'll manage it well, by God's grace.

00:12:34.314 --> 00:12:35.582
Yes, bring it over.

00:12:50.664 --> 00:12:51.631
Goodness.

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:55.502
It's quite a bit this time.

00:12:55.502 --> 00:12:57.337
Making a perfect child is...

00:12:57.337 --> 00:12:59.105
no cheap matter.

00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:01.942
You can only cover it
with foundation funds so many times.

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:04.511
I trust you'll manage it well, Pastor.

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:08.381
Please don't think of this place
as a church.

00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:10.917
A laundry.

00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:12.519
Think of it as a laundry.

00:13:14.154 --> 00:13:18.191
But I don't think she's discussed this
with her husband yet.

00:13:18.992 --> 00:13:21.294
I'm not sure
if sperm collection will be easy.

00:13:21.294 --> 00:13:23.730
Don't worry about that.

00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:26.499
He's utterly devoted to his wife.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.268
That's great.

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:31.905
Then we'll need
to meet Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man soon.

00:13:32.572 --> 00:13:36.843
I've been wondering how to win him over.

00:13:36.843 --> 00:13:38.845
Do you have a strategy?

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:42.649
Well, I've just acquired a very good card.

00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:45.352
A good card?

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:49.289
Calling embryos babies. I can't even.

00:13:49.289 --> 00:13:51.424
Aren't people ridiculous?

00:13:51.424 --> 00:13:54.261
It's just somatic cells like a fingernail.

00:13:54.694 --> 00:13:57.597
Koreans really empathize too much.

00:13:59.099 --> 00:14:00.200
Indeed they do.

00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:06.539
(Holy Bible, Revised Korean Version)

00:14:08.808 --> 00:14:10.810
What I do is...

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.679
create humans,

00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:17.083
so God will be pleased too.

00:14:18.084 --> 00:14:20.553
God loves mankind, doesn't He?

00:14:20.553 --> 00:14:22.522
Of course.

00:14:22.522 --> 00:14:25.458
Creating a proper life is
such a miraculous thing,

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:27.227
especially in this era of low birthrates.

00:14:27.227 --> 00:14:30.363
This is such a groundbreaking
and creative...

00:14:32.499 --> 00:14:33.567
(Madam)

00:14:37.537 --> 00:14:39.539
Yes, hello?

00:14:39.539 --> 00:14:42.175
Sister, you know,

00:14:42.442 --> 00:14:43.910
I realized...

00:14:44.377 --> 00:14:49.115
I'm too old to give birth myself.

00:14:51.051 --> 00:14:52.819
So, I was thinking...

00:14:57.357 --> 00:14:58.425
Yes.

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:04.664
I'm sorry to visit so late, Ms. Park.

00:15:05.298 --> 00:15:06.499
By any chance...

00:15:10.203 --> 00:15:11.137
Ah Hyun.

00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:15.342
What brings you here at this hour?
Don't you have to be in an academy?

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.577
Well,

00:15:18.378 --> 00:15:20.814
I was just wondering
if you'd heard anything about Si Woo.

00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:23.817
Si Woo?

00:15:29.656 --> 00:15:31.057
We're still looking for him.

00:15:32.926 --> 00:15:36.096
But thank you so much for worrying
about Si Woo like this, Ah Hyun.

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:43.003
He was such a good kid, wasn't he?

00:15:47.807 --> 00:15:50.477
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.
I shouldn't have come.

00:15:51.344 --> 00:15:52.445
I'll get going.

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:56.516
If I hear anything about Si Woo,
I'll contact you right away.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.485
Thank you, Ah Hyun.

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.520
Be careful on your way back.

00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:08.428
But Ah Hyun,

00:16:10.063 --> 00:16:11.531
where did you get those shoes?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.401
Pardon?

00:16:14.401 --> 00:16:16.937
I've been looking everywhere
for that style lately.

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:35.455
Detective Choi.

00:16:36.489 --> 00:16:37.557
What brings you here?

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.395
Detective Choi, you'll work yourself
to death at this rate.

00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:44.030
People don't die that easily.

00:16:44.564 --> 00:16:46.032
Tell that to the ones who did.

00:16:46.032 --> 00:16:48.001
- Investigator.
- Yes?

00:16:48.001 --> 00:16:49.236
- Over here.
- Okay.

00:17:04.384 --> 00:17:05.218
What's the update?

00:17:05.218 --> 00:17:07.754
They found the actual owner of the phone.

00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:10.423
A man named Woo Tae Sik, in his 40s.

00:17:10.423 --> 00:17:12.292
I sent the photo via text.

00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:13.126
Okay.

00:17:13.894 --> 00:17:14.794
I got it.

00:17:21.334 --> 00:17:22.402
Woo Tae Sik.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.045
How do you even use this thing?

00:17:33.246 --> 00:17:34.381
Are we supposed to take this somewhere?

00:17:42.989 --> 00:17:45.926
Han Cheol Soo was found dead
at his residence.

00:17:45.926 --> 00:17:46.893
Dead?

00:17:50.664 --> 00:17:52.566
Secure CCTV footage near his home.

00:17:54.401 --> 00:17:55.602
But we didn't kill him.

00:17:56.903 --> 00:17:58.638
We need to leave.

00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:01.007
Ah Hyun.

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:03.910
Are we going somewhere again?

00:18:09.849 --> 00:18:10.717
What?

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:15.322
(Wife)

00:18:21.494 --> 00:18:22.362
- So Mi.
- Hello?

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.731
Mom.

00:18:25.732 --> 00:18:26.766
Mom!

00:18:27.234 --> 00:18:28.301
Mom!

00:18:29.236 --> 00:18:30.203
Honey.

00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:32.739
Mom.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.041
Can you hear my voice?

00:18:37.844 --> 00:18:39.479
Honey.

00:18:40.513 --> 00:18:41.948
You don't need to come this week.

00:18:42.649 --> 00:18:45.952
I'm doing fine, so don't come this week.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.857
You're busy next week
with the superintendent visiting.

00:18:52.225 --> 00:18:54.294
The teachers here are all treating me
really well.

00:18:54.995 --> 00:18:56.630
So come next week.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.099
Mom, what are you saying?

00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:02.002
Mom, what are you talking about?

00:19:02.435 --> 00:19:03.670
Mom, where are you now?

00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:06.473
Honey.

00:19:08.708 --> 00:19:10.143
Is Yu Na doing well?

00:19:12.545 --> 00:19:15.582
Don't bring her with you when you come.

00:19:16.816 --> 00:19:18.785
She's busy preparing for her audition.

00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:22.222
When she has an audition,

00:19:23.189 --> 00:19:25.025
I'm supposed to go with her.

00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:29.629
Once I get discharged,

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.866
I'll take her to the audition,

00:19:33.867 --> 00:19:35.268
pack her lunch,

00:19:35.902 --> 00:19:37.837
and tell her she did great.

00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:41.808
Tell her that, honey.

00:19:47.547 --> 00:19:48.415
Mom?

00:20:11.404 --> 00:20:12.939
This is what my husband is like.

00:20:13.673 --> 00:20:15.141
You have no idea how sweet he is.

00:20:16.009 --> 00:20:18.812
So if you keep bothering me,
I'll tell on you to him.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:44.804
Ma'am.

00:20:46.506 --> 00:20:48.942
Do you think
your daughter will really not come...

00:20:51.111 --> 00:20:52.178
if you act like this?

00:21:21.207 --> 00:21:21.942
Guys.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.312
Let's go find So Mi's mom.

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:27.213
Ah Hyun.

00:21:27.213 --> 00:21:28.114
Are you insane?

00:21:28.848 --> 00:21:31.618
Those bastards will be all over
that place. Why go there?

00:21:32.044 --> 00:21:33.979
We don't even know how to use that card.

00:21:35.514 --> 00:21:36.916
So Mi's mom will know.

00:21:38.284 --> 00:21:39.919
Let's find her...

00:21:40.786 --> 00:21:42.254
and ask how to use the card too.

00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:44.957
Still, this is too much.

00:21:44.957 --> 00:21:45.958
Seok Su.

00:21:53.098 --> 00:21:54.300
Ah Hyun, thank you.

00:22:00.206 --> 00:22:02.007
Si Woo, you...

00:22:04.343 --> 00:22:05.444
Are you really going?

00:22:13.686 --> 00:22:14.753
I mean,

00:22:15.254 --> 00:22:17.289
after childbirth, you lose hair,

00:22:17.756 --> 00:22:19.358
and your skin suffers too.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.797
Since I'm in the public eye,
I have to care about these things.

00:22:26.198 --> 00:22:27.399
Of course.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.101
Of course, you should.

00:22:32.504 --> 00:22:33.839
About using a surrogate.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.509
You can guarantee confidentiality, right?

00:22:40.346 --> 00:22:43.048
I'll stake everything to protect it.

00:22:51.257 --> 00:22:53.459
Trusting the Lord isn't hard,

00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:56.562
but why is trusting a person so difficult?

00:22:57.263 --> 00:22:58.197
Excuse me?

00:22:58.864 --> 00:23:00.499
Given my position,

00:23:01.433 --> 00:23:03.435
discerning people is part of my job.

00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:06.805
So...

00:23:10.709 --> 00:23:12.811
How can I help you?

00:23:13.646 --> 00:23:15.281
Please leave behind
some kind of collateral.

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:20.252
Something I can trust a hundred percent.

00:23:21.253 --> 00:23:22.655
What do you mean?

00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:27.693
I heard your daughter is
exceptionally gifted.

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:34.667
I want the woman who bears my child
to be perfect...

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.175
like you, Sister Kim Se Hee.

00:23:46.979 --> 00:23:48.314
Fourteen years old.

00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:52.484
They say Mary was 14...

00:23:53.252 --> 00:23:54.687
when she conceived Jesus.

00:23:57.823 --> 00:23:59.758
And my daughter is 14 right now.

00:24:04.396 --> 00:24:05.397
Do you want it?

00:24:17.643 --> 00:24:19.044
Ah Hyun, enjoy your meal.

00:24:19.812 --> 00:24:20.679
Okay.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:25.618
What is it, Mom?

00:24:27.953 --> 00:24:28.921
Ah Hyun.

00:24:31.524 --> 00:24:34.226
You're such a precious child to me.

00:24:34.226 --> 00:24:35.561
A gift.

00:24:37.997 --> 00:24:38.864
Me too.

00:24:39.465 --> 00:24:41.200
You're precious to me too, Mom.

00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:43.636
Really?

00:24:46.038 --> 00:24:47.239
Thank you, honey.

00:24:50.376 --> 00:24:51.443
There's something...

00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:54.713
I'd like to ask you, Ah Hyun.

00:24:57.249 --> 00:24:58.317
You'll help, right?

00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:31.417
I'll do it.

00:25:33.485 --> 00:25:34.320
Let's go in.

00:25:48.634 --> 00:25:49.501
Shit.

00:26:10.022 --> 00:26:10.990
Shit.

00:26:12.057 --> 00:26:13.459
Is it just me,
or does this place feel wrong?

00:26:14.193 --> 00:26:15.761
It doesn't feel like a hospital.

00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:31.604
Let's go.

00:27:43.115 --> 00:27:44.116
Who are you?

00:27:48.787 --> 00:27:50.356
Who are you people?

00:27:56.061 --> 00:27:57.229
What is it?

00:27:57.229 --> 00:27:58.163
There they are!

00:28:01.133 --> 00:28:02.535
Seok Su, let's go.

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:21.554
Catch them.

00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:36.368
Get them.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.327
Seok Su!

00:29:38.531 --> 00:29:39.398
Open it.

00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:42.001
Open it!

00:29:42.001 --> 00:29:43.135
Open this!

00:29:55.514 --> 00:29:56.749
(Im Gyeong Mi/F)

00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:58.083
Ju An.

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:01.086
Here.

00:30:06.492 --> 00:30:07.293
Let's go.

00:30:14.867 --> 00:30:15.768
Yu Na.

00:30:15.768 --> 00:30:18.637
My baby.

00:30:18.637 --> 00:30:20.172
Are you hurt, Yu Na?

00:30:21.373 --> 00:30:23.709
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

00:30:23.709 --> 00:30:24.543
Mom.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.445
I'm your daughter, right?

00:30:27.446 --> 00:30:28.781
You didn't abandon me, right?

00:30:29.815 --> 00:30:31.750
What are you saying?

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.719
Yu Na.

00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:36.088
My girl.

00:30:36.088 --> 00:30:38.724
Mom, I doubted you.

00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:42.561
I didn't trust you. I even cursed you.

00:30:45.497 --> 00:30:47.132
It's my fault.

00:30:47.132 --> 00:30:48.534
I'm sorry, Yu Na.

00:30:49.635 --> 00:30:52.137
Mom, why did you hide that I was adopted?

00:31:06.585 --> 00:31:10.456
From the moment I first met you, I knew.

00:31:11.056 --> 00:31:13.158
I gave birth to this child.

00:31:13.158 --> 00:31:16.395
So no matter what anyone says,
you are my daughter, okay?

00:31:18.197 --> 00:31:21.367
Mom, did you buy me with money too?

00:31:21.967 --> 00:31:23.536
Yu Na.

00:31:23.536 --> 00:31:25.337
Please, Mom. You have to tell me.

00:31:26.071 --> 00:31:29.408
Did you also go to one of those places
where they sell children for money?

00:31:29.742 --> 00:31:32.645
Mom, do you have one of these too?

00:31:32.645 --> 00:31:33.579
Do you know what this is?

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:35.180
No, I don't. I don't know what that is.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.849
No, I don't know.

00:31:36.849 --> 00:31:37.783
Mom.

00:31:38.517 --> 00:31:40.252
Please, Mom. You have to tell me.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.857
Then you'll be in danger, Yu Na.

00:31:44.857 --> 00:31:47.126
Those people are dangerous.

00:31:47.126 --> 00:31:48.494
Never go near them.

00:31:48.494 --> 00:31:50.396
Don't even try to find out.

00:31:55.634 --> 00:31:57.102
We're out of time. We have to go now.

00:31:57.102 --> 00:31:59.137
Mom, let's just go for now.

00:31:59.638 --> 00:32:00.973
Let's go for now, get in.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.424
Mom!

00:32:52.624 --> 00:32:53.358
Mom!

00:33:03.802 --> 00:33:05.871
Mom, no. Get up.

00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:07.739
Hurry, go!

00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:09.207
- Mom!
- We have to go now.

00:33:09.207 --> 00:33:10.108
No.

00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:12.711
Mom, no!

00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:13.679
Catch them!

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:21.687
Wait.

00:33:21.987 --> 00:33:22.821
The kids.

00:33:39.238 --> 00:33:41.740
Why do you all keep struggling to live,

00:33:42.874 --> 00:33:44.109
just like cockroaches?

00:33:46.745 --> 00:33:47.846
Cockroaches.

00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:50.582
If they're caught, they die.

00:33:50.949 --> 00:33:51.583
Like this.

00:35:05.123 --> 00:35:05.924
Are you okay?

00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:07.159
Let's go.

00:35:10.095 --> 00:35:10.996
Let's go.

00:35:15.901 --> 00:35:17.169
Go get them.

00:35:20.005 --> 00:35:20.839
Get them!

00:35:25.644 --> 00:35:26.478
Let's go.

00:36:23.635 --> 00:36:24.803
Are you alright, Jung Hyun?

00:36:25.804 --> 00:36:26.738
I'm sorry.

00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:30.609
Do you need more men?

00:36:32.644 --> 00:36:33.512
No.

00:36:33.845 --> 00:36:35.514
It's okay. Tell me if you do.

00:36:36.315 --> 00:36:38.016
I'm sorry. I'll make sure...

00:36:39.217 --> 00:36:43.422
You know you're my favorite, right?

00:36:45.123 --> 00:36:46.858
So you can't get hurt.

00:37:03.976 --> 00:37:04.776
Stop.

00:37:05.377 --> 00:37:07.346
Get him off.

00:37:09.848 --> 00:37:11.516
That's enough.

00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:13.585
Are you okay?

00:37:26.665 --> 00:37:27.866
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:37:27.866 --> 00:37:29.034
That punk.

00:37:29.034 --> 00:37:30.168
Let's go to the hospital.

00:37:30.168 --> 00:37:31.837
That guy is insane.

00:37:31.837 --> 00:37:33.338
No wonder he's a murderer's kid.

00:37:33.972 --> 00:37:34.806
Let's go.

00:37:35.173 --> 00:37:36.541
It's true.

00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:38.443
His dad killed his mom
right after he was born...

00:37:38.443 --> 00:37:40.178
and went to prison.

00:37:40.178 --> 00:37:42.381
He's got the eyes of a killer too.

00:37:42.381 --> 00:37:44.116
It's not the first time. Let's just go.

00:37:56.261 --> 00:37:57.396
You're Jung Hyun, right?

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.142
That must hurt.

00:38:22.588 --> 00:38:25.924
Every time you get hurt,
I can treat you...

00:38:28.727 --> 00:38:29.861
like a mom.

00:38:32.965 --> 00:38:34.066
Do you want me to be your mom?

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.735
Then Jung Hyun,

00:38:36.735 --> 00:38:39.071
can you become someone I need as well?

00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:44.209
Try calling me Mom.

00:38:48.981 --> 00:38:50.549
I'll make no mistakes, Director.

00:38:55.487 --> 00:38:57.222
These days, you don't even call me Mom.

00:39:02.527 --> 00:39:04.029
Next time, try calling me Mom.

00:39:22.414 --> 00:39:23.849
Your mom will be fine.

00:39:25.684 --> 00:39:26.785
When it's all over,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.288
let's go get her back.

00:39:35.093 --> 00:39:36.628
Do you think we can do it?

00:39:40.933 --> 00:39:42.167
Mom said...

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.538
they're even more dangerous...

00:39:47.806 --> 00:39:49.308
than we think.

00:39:50.142 --> 00:39:51.043
Hey.

00:39:52.411 --> 00:39:53.745
Don't talk like a coward.

00:39:55.547 --> 00:39:58.850
For now, I'm tracking their movement.

00:39:59.318 --> 00:40:00.552
So just hang in there a bit.

00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:09.962
I'll do it.

00:40:35.287 --> 00:40:36.221
Found it.

00:40:52.204 --> 00:40:53.138
Let me see.

00:40:55.073 --> 00:40:56.675
What even is this place?

00:40:57.949 --> 00:40:58.917
Is there any signal here?

00:41:01.352 --> 00:41:02.086
Yes?

00:41:03.888 --> 00:41:04.789
No.

00:41:10.206 --> 00:41:11.774
We can't run forensics on this.

00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:14.377
The chief said not to accept it.

00:41:14.377 --> 00:41:15.144
What?

00:41:15.144 --> 00:41:17.179
He said the case would be closed anyway.

00:41:17.179 --> 00:41:18.881
He dumped a bunch of other things
and left.

00:41:22.118 --> 00:41:23.519
Then what do we do with this?

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.856
If you really have to do it,
maybe try a private firm.

00:41:26.856 --> 00:41:27.823
A firm?

00:41:32.228 --> 00:41:33.362
A private firm. Fine.

00:41:41.137 --> 00:41:42.004
Detective Choi.

00:41:42.405 --> 00:41:43.906
Can't we just not take this?

00:41:44.373 --> 00:41:46.409
I really have a bad feeling about it.

00:41:46.409 --> 00:41:47.843
That's exactly why we have to do it.

00:41:48.578 --> 00:41:49.612
Aren't you a cop?

00:41:50.012 --> 00:41:51.514
That's not what I'm saying.

00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:04.060
(Kwon Sung Woo, son of Kwon Kang Man,
found dead from school violence)

00:42:07.029 --> 00:42:08.064
Were you in the same class as Sung Woo?

00:42:08.064 --> 00:42:09.332
(3 years ago)

00:42:09.332 --> 00:42:10.399
Were you close with Sung Woo?

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.569
Not really. We were just classmates.

00:42:14.537 --> 00:42:17.907
Did you ever see him being bullied
or anything like that?

00:42:18.441 --> 00:42:20.076
No, among our classmates...

00:42:20.076 --> 00:42:20.943
They're here!

00:42:22.645 --> 00:42:24.380
Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man,
how do you feel?

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.715
Please say a few words.

00:42:25.715 --> 00:42:27.617
Please, just a word.

00:42:29.385 --> 00:42:31.420
- How are you feeling?
- Just a brief comment, sir.

00:42:33.422 --> 00:42:36.325
Our poor Sung Woo.

00:42:40.363 --> 00:42:41.664
Sung Woo.

00:42:43.633 --> 00:42:45.902
My poor baby.

00:42:46.802 --> 00:42:50.540
What do I do?

00:42:51.207 --> 00:42:52.975
I'm currently at the school...

00:42:52.975 --> 00:42:54.477
where the funeral for Kwon Sung Woo,
son of Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man,

00:42:54.477 --> 00:42:57.580
senior member of the New Gyeore Party,
is being held.

00:42:58.147 --> 00:43:00.049
In attendance were
Assemblyman Kwon himself,

00:43:00.049 --> 00:43:02.084
the Youth Chairperson
of the New Gyeore Party,

00:43:02.084 --> 00:43:03.519
and also...

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:06.222
the Presidential Office's
School Violence Task Force.

00:43:06.222 --> 00:43:08.057
Other parties, including the ruling party,

00:43:08.057 --> 00:43:09.825
also sent condolence wreaths.

00:43:09.825 --> 00:43:11.861
And the perpetrators didn't attend...

00:43:11.861 --> 00:43:13.763
the funeral?

00:43:13.763 --> 00:43:14.830
Yes, that's correct.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.099
Kwon Sung Woo endured
continued school violence...

00:43:17.099 --> 00:43:20.436
and tragically took his own life
last Sunday.

00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:23.472
The three students identified
as perpetrators...

00:43:23.472 --> 00:43:24.473
submitted withdrawal forms...

00:43:24.473 --> 00:43:27.343
the next day, Monday,

00:43:27.343 --> 00:43:29.979
and are currently
under police investigation.

00:43:36.919 --> 00:43:38.321
Detective Choi.

00:43:43.526 --> 00:43:46.162
I don't get him.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.672
Not even a single ant is showing up.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.574
I'm starving.

00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:00.843
We've been standing here
for seven hours now.

00:44:00.843 --> 00:44:02.745
We should take turns.

00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:03.713
Let me see.

00:44:13.322 --> 00:44:14.590
Nothing's happened yet, right?

00:44:16.092 --> 00:44:17.026
Do you want to switch?

00:44:18.127 --> 00:44:18.861
Okay.

00:44:23.933 --> 00:44:25.368
- Did you get some rest?
- Yes.

00:44:26.135 --> 00:44:27.370
It must be hard.

00:44:28.004 --> 00:44:28.938
Are you okay?

00:44:32.241 --> 00:44:33.509
There are a lot of cars coming in.

00:44:33.876 --> 00:44:34.677
What?

00:44:37.647 --> 00:44:38.481
Let me see.

00:44:55.831 --> 00:44:56.699
I found it.

00:45:19.055 --> 00:45:20.456
Door closing.

00:45:22.425 --> 00:45:23.593
First basement.

00:45:28.664 --> 00:45:29.699
Where is this place?

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.242
What is this place?

00:45:45.648 --> 00:45:46.749
Please choose one.

00:45:47.316 --> 00:45:48.150
Masks?

00:45:57.293 --> 00:45:58.427
Confirmed.

00:46:24.954 --> 00:46:26.556
We will begin the auction.

00:46:27.456 --> 00:46:30.426
All items today are from people
with IQs over 148,

00:46:30.426 --> 00:46:32.762
ovarian age under 25,

00:46:32.762 --> 00:46:34.630
with both intellectual
and physical condition...

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.766
only at the highest grade.

00:46:38.801 --> 00:46:42.171
There are a total of eight items
for auction today.

00:46:43.072 --> 00:46:43.906
Auction?

00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:47.176
- An auction? What's going on?
- No way.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.611
No way.

00:46:49.378 --> 00:46:50.613
Here is the first item.

00:46:52.548 --> 00:46:54.750
Approximately 72 hours since birth.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.220
Blood type A, male infant.

00:47:00.356 --> 00:47:02.024
The father graduated early
from a science high school...

00:47:02.024 --> 00:47:03.893
and was the youngest ever admitted
to Stanford School of Engineering.

00:47:04.627 --> 00:47:07.029
The mother, a Seoul National University
medical student...

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.830
and a member of Mensa...

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.665
Look at that smile.

00:47:09.932 --> 00:47:11.500
How adorable.

00:47:12.468 --> 00:47:14.270
Born naturally through a surrogate mother,

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.172
and of course,
both father and mother have...

00:47:16.172 --> 00:47:17.940
no knowledge of the child's existence.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.508
This is top one-percent genetics.

00:47:19.508 --> 00:47:21.944
We start with a top-quality product
from the very first item.

00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:23.913
The minimum bid starts
at 250 thousand dollars...

00:47:23.913 --> 00:47:27.383
with a full refund available
until the age of 18.

00:47:27.383 --> 00:47:29.585
Refund is possible
under any circumstance, right?

00:47:30.253 --> 00:47:31.621
Apart from physical defects,

00:47:31.621 --> 00:47:34.690
refunds due to simple change
of mind are not allowed,

00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:37.827
but partial refunds may be possible
depending on the situation.

00:47:40.997 --> 00:47:43.766
Does it have any genetic defects?

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.301
In the paternal DNA,

00:47:45.301 --> 00:47:48.037
a gene associated
with ischemic heart disease was found,

00:47:48.037 --> 00:47:50.373
but it was safely removed
during cultivation,

00:47:50.373 --> 00:47:52.542
and there are no physical
functional abnormalities.

00:47:53.409 --> 00:47:55.378
No need to worry.

00:47:56.512 --> 00:47:59.081
Highest bid at 495 thousand.

00:47:59.515 --> 00:48:01.817
Highest bid at 498 thousand.

00:48:02.251 --> 00:48:03.753
We have 510 thousand.

00:48:04.253 --> 00:48:07.023
Five hundred ten thousand.

00:48:07.023 --> 00:48:08.925
Sold at 510 thousand dollars.

00:48:08.925 --> 00:48:09.892
Five hundred ten thousand?

00:48:11.694 --> 00:48:13.095
Seriously?

00:48:13.863 --> 00:48:15.798
Then...

00:48:16.599 --> 00:48:18.134
the parents who abandoned us...

00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:20.970
became parents like this?

00:48:25.074 --> 00:48:26.142
Was my mom...

00:48:28.544 --> 00:48:30.213
one of those people?

00:48:30.947 --> 00:48:32.048
No way.

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.292
- We bought a good one, right?
- We did.

00:48:46.896 --> 00:48:48.297
Here is the second item.

00:48:48.864 --> 00:48:50.833
Approximately 48 hours since birth.

00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:53.102
Blood type O, female infant.

00:48:53.102 --> 00:48:56.005
You all remember the genius boy,
Son Yoo Jun, right?

00:48:56.005 --> 00:48:58.341
We've secured his genes.

00:48:58.875 --> 00:49:01.244
The mother is the same as the first item,

00:49:01.244 --> 00:49:03.279
but the father's appearance is top tier.

00:49:04.046 --> 00:49:05.348
The appraised value is over 500 thousand.

00:49:05.348 --> 00:49:07.383
The minimum bid starts
at 470 thousand dollars.

00:49:10.186 --> 00:49:12.088
Bidding starts now.

00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:17.093
Bid at 590 thousand.

00:49:17.393 --> 00:49:18.461
Bid at 595.

00:49:19.395 --> 00:49:20.329
Bid at 610.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:21.864
Bid at 660.

00:49:22.698 --> 00:49:23.599
Bid at 690.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.334
Bid at 720.

00:49:26.135 --> 00:49:27.103
Eight hundred.

00:49:27.436 --> 00:49:28.437
Eight hundred fifty.

00:49:29.338 --> 00:49:30.273
Nine hundred.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.674
Nine hundred fifty.

00:49:32.675 --> 00:49:33.709
Nine hundred fifty-three.

00:49:34.277 --> 00:49:35.344
Nine hundred fifty-four.

00:49:36.212 --> 00:49:38.848
Nine hundred fifty-five.

00:49:39.482 --> 00:49:40.516
Nine hundred fifty-five.

00:49:40.983 --> 00:49:43.019
Sold at 955 thousand dollars.

00:50:09.512 --> 00:50:12.281
Yes, we got a good one.

00:50:12.782 --> 00:50:15.017
I think we can return that one now.

00:50:16.519 --> 00:50:19.422
Yes, request a refund. It's useless.

00:50:46.649 --> 00:50:47.516
Why?

00:50:56.726 --> 00:51:00.263
(The Defects,
Epilogue)

00:51:02.164 --> 00:51:03.866
Yoon Seo, congratulations
on getting first place.

00:51:03.866 --> 00:51:05.568
You did so well.

00:51:05.568 --> 00:51:06.402
Thank you.

00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:11.240
Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.076
Hello. You must be happy.
Congratulations to you too, Yoon Seo.

00:51:14.644 --> 00:51:15.845
Thank you.

00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:17.747
- Congratulations, Yoon Seo.
- Bye.

00:51:17.747 --> 00:51:19.282
Bye. Congratulations to you too.

00:51:19.282 --> 00:51:21.918
- We'll get going first.
- Yes, take care.

00:51:21.918 --> 00:51:23.486
Yoon Seo, congratulations on first place.

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.997
Ah Hyun.

00:51:37.266 --> 00:51:38.000
Yes?

00:51:38.634 --> 00:51:39.468
Do you think this is funny?

00:51:40.636 --> 00:51:41.737
This is a contest.

00:51:42.505 --> 00:51:43.506
It's a competition.

00:51:44.173 --> 00:51:46.442
Stepping on others to stand at the top.

00:51:46.442 --> 00:51:47.476
Surviving.

00:51:49.645 --> 00:51:50.780
But today,

00:51:52.014 --> 00:51:54.150
I congratulated Yoon Seo's mom.

00:51:54.984 --> 00:51:56.586
Do you know what that means?

00:52:00.623 --> 00:52:01.691
Because of you,

00:52:02.959 --> 00:52:05.661
I became a lower person than her.
That's what it means.

00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:06.629
Because of you,

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:09.398
she's standing on top of me.

00:52:14.737 --> 00:52:17.373
Do you know why adults give awards
to second and third-place winners?

00:52:18.207 --> 00:52:19.542
Why?

00:52:20.009 --> 00:52:21.777
Because by praising the second
and third-place winners,

00:52:21.777 --> 00:52:23.446
the first-place winner looks
even greater.

00:52:23.446 --> 00:52:26.282
They're saying 1st is more amazing
because it stands on top of 2nd and 3rd.

00:52:26.816 --> 00:52:28.584
Do you know why award ceremonies start
with third-place winners?

00:52:29.051 --> 00:52:31.220
So the first place stands out more.

00:52:31.821 --> 00:52:32.889
Normally,

00:52:32.889 --> 00:52:35.057
shouldn't the best person get
the award first?

00:52:35.992 --> 00:52:38.494
But I still did better than third place.

00:52:40.763 --> 00:52:42.198
That's not the point.

00:52:42.899 --> 00:52:45.735
The only thing that matters is
that you didn't win first place.

00:52:45.735 --> 00:52:47.370
The fact that you lost to Yoon Seo again.

00:52:48.204 --> 00:52:49.939
I never lost to Yoon Seo.

00:52:50.873 --> 00:52:51.707
What?

00:52:52.275 --> 00:52:53.943
We've never fought.

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.351
So you were fighting with me.

00:53:03.886 --> 00:53:04.954
What?

00:53:04.954 --> 00:53:06.255
I thought it was strange.

00:53:07.456 --> 00:53:09.425
Your grades and abilities are similar.

00:53:09.425 --> 00:53:10.927
There's not much difference.

00:53:11.591 --> 00:53:13.192
But you're always in second place,

00:53:13.192 --> 00:53:15.461
and Yoon Seo is always in first.
Doesn't that seem odd?

00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:19.332
As if you're trying hard
to only stay second.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.068
I've never done that.

00:53:22.702 --> 00:53:24.670
Yoon Seo's just always better than me.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:25.471
No.

00:53:27.106 --> 00:53:28.274
Even by chance,

00:53:28.474 --> 00:53:30.176
you could've won first place
at least once.

00:53:30.176 --> 00:53:31.611
But every time,

00:53:31.611 --> 00:53:33.079
every single time, you're in second place,

00:53:34.647 --> 00:53:36.349
as if you're deliberately trying
to spite me.

00:53:38.184 --> 00:53:40.920
No, it's not like that, Mom.

00:53:42.455 --> 00:53:43.289
Tell me.

00:53:43.689 --> 00:53:45.124
The one you really want to beat is...

00:53:46.726 --> 00:53:47.860
me, isn't it?

00:53:49.095 --> 00:53:50.029
Ah Hyun.

00:54:24.764 --> 00:54:27.533
(The Defects)

00:54:27.834 --> 00:54:30.736
Please propose just one quick
legal amendment.

00:54:30.736 --> 00:54:33.039
Let's fix a few lines
in the Bioethics Law.

00:54:33.306 --> 00:54:35.675
There was nothing legal from the start.

00:54:36.042 --> 00:54:37.009
Even us.

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:39.345
Now we have to face it head-on.

00:54:39.946 --> 00:54:41.481
Let's find them.

00:54:42.114 --> 00:54:43.483
About Kwon Sung Woo.

00:54:43.483 --> 00:54:45.084
Is he really dead?

00:54:45.084 --> 00:54:46.185
Assemblyman, just do your job.

00:54:46.185 --> 00:54:47.720
Take full responsibility
and make it certain.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.622
Let's get as many samples as we can today.

00:54:50.223 --> 00:54:52.692
One of the samples is missing.

00:54:53.025 --> 00:54:54.193
We need to hurry.

00:54:54.594 --> 00:54:56.095
Lock down the entire building.

00:54:56.796 --> 00:54:57.730
Immediately!

00:54:58.598 --> 00:54:59.699
Finally, we meet.

00:54:59.699 --> 00:55:02.034
This will turn Korea upside down,
won't it?

00:55:02.034 --> 00:55:02.969
Remove the mask!

00:55:03.736 --> 00:55:04.570
Ah Hyun!

00:55:10.576 --> 00:55:12.576
