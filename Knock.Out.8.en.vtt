This series is a work of fiction.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560
Do you even realize you were drugged with a diuretic, Thun?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.120
They still haven’t found who did it.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.560
I knew you were going to say sorry.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.800
You didn’t do anything wrong, Keen.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.840
These fuckers are screwing over the public!

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.600
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.960
It's ok.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.320
I really needed to pee, so I stopped by to relieve myself.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.000
And ended up stumbling across a corpse.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.680
I think Muay’s death and your father’s

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.720
was commited by the same person.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.680
And based on the evidence I have right now...

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200
But you’re still my son!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.920
Pakorn is the killer.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.240
Let me be a father for once.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240
Why would you even try now?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.720
You’re ten years too late.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960
You fucking suck!

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.840
But still… you’re my son!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.160
About what I said.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.440
If you ever change your mind, just let me know.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.480
Betrayal

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.480
Oh! Mr.Phuwish, when did you get here?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480
Oh..

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.520
Petch, hello.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.920
Hello.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.160
I came to visit Thun.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.240
Ah.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600
Hello, Coach.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.000
Hello.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.000
I really have to thank you, Mr.Phuwish,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.600
for being so kind and stepping in for Thun.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.120
Ah.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.720
If you hadn’t helped,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.200
I honestly wouldn’t know how I was going to pay for Thun’s medical bills.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.960
Oh, it’s nothing, Coach Petch.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.800
We’re not strangers.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.640
Once we start helping, we’ve got to see it through.
Yes.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.720
Look at him.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.240
I can finally breathe a little.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.760
Yeah.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.280
He’s not seriously hurt or anything.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.840
Thanks again, Mr.Phuwish.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.160
Happy to help, Thun.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.080
Actually, I was going to find you, Coach Petch.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.080
I’ve got something important I want to talk to you about.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.160
It’s about the Petchsak Academy.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.200
I’ll come visit the gym this evening.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.560
I want to see how everyone’s doing.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560
You’re more than welcome.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560
Alright, I’ll see you there then.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.760
I’ll be going now.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.280
Okay.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.240
Come on, I’ll walk you out.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.040
Oh, thank you.
Take care.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.360
See you soon.
See you.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.480
Goodbye.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.000
Yes.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.480
Thanks again, Coach Petch.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.640
Hey, Mai, come help carry some stuff.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.560
Sure, Uncle Petch.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.840
Hello.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.080
It’s so hot.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.680
How are you feeling, bro? Tired from the long drive?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.440
Just a bit.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440
Have you eaten yet?

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.920
Huh?

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.160
Have you eaten yet?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.840
Not yet. Got anything to eat?

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.680
I prepared something. Bought it and waited for you all to get back.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.080
Really?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.520
I'm tired, let’s head inside.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.880
What happened here?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.800
Why such a mess?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.880
Again?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.120
Let’s check first to see if anything’s missing.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.040
Uncle Petch! Everyone! It’s bad!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.720
Something’s happened! Someone broke into the gym!

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.000
Hurry, Uncle Petch!

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.280
Where is the thief, Mai?

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.640
I didn’t see anyone, Uncle.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.560
Shit.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.040
Why the hell is your room this trashed?

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.960
We don’t know.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.880
It was like this when we got here.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.880
Where’s Ait?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.840
Check if anything’s missing.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.640
Nothing’s gone.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.000
Let’s double-check just to be sure.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.000
Shit… Ait..

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.080
Nothing’s missing from my stuff.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.680
Same with me.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.320
Then what the hell was the person searching for in your room?

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.160
Coach, Ait’s gone.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.600
He packed up and took all his stuff.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.680
Could it have been Ait?

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.000
Ait?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.800
But why would he do something like that?

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.600
And nothing was even stolen.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.000
I don’t think it was Ait.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.400
He’s not that kind of person.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.160
I don’t want to think it was Ait either.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.920
But the room’s a wreck,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.840
and now he’s gone again, what am I supposed to think?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.080
Maybe it was something urgent and he left quickly without telling anyone

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.400
His sister’s still sick, remember?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.600
But why are you defending Ait so much?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.680
Let’s go.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.200
Hey, what the hell?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.800
Hey!
Stop!

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.200
What are you guys doing?!

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.640
Hey, grab him!

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.320
Shit!

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.840
Thun!

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.840
Stop!

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.760
Mai!

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.920
If you don’t want to die,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.080
stay fucking still!

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.800
You heard him, stay still. Bring him here!

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.880
You! Come here!

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.400
Bro!

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.120
Please leave him alone.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.400
Come here.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.960
He told you to stay still.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.840
Stop it!

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.880
Hey!

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.120
I said stay still!
Hey, stop!

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.120
Stay still!

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.240
Please! Please don’t hurt my son!

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.400
I’m begging you!

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.280
If you don’t want anything to happen to him, then pay back Sia Thep.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.040
That’s all.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.760
I don’t have the money right now.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.920
Just give me a bit more time.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.600
You want more time? Ha!

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.080
You want time?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.760
Fine.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.520
You want time?!

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.800
No, please!

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.360
Mawin!

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.920
You want time?!

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.200
Stop!

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.800
You want time?!

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.880
That’s enough.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.640
Please stop.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.600
Give us more time.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.760
I’ll go fight and I’ll pay it all back.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.080
I don’t care how you do it, but I need Sia Thep’s money!

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.480
Now! Right now.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.240
Or else..

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.800
How do I open this?!

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.560
No!

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.760
Don’t!

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.040
Give me my money!

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.560
No..

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.840
Where’s my money?!

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.280
Let him go!

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.920
Don’t, he’s got a gun.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.480
Let me go!

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.000
Hey!

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Thun!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.720
Stay still!

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.160
What’s going on here?!

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.600
Why are you doing this?!

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.520
MP Phuwish.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.760
Yes.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.480
They owe my boss money, sir.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.520
But they kept stalling,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.000
so we had to do this.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.120
This country has laws.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.000
Who’s your boss, anyway?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
How dare you act like you’re above the law?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.440
Our boss is Sia Thep.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.520
You must’ve heard of him.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.760
Ah.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.880
I thought so, I figured Sia Thep wasn’t a good person.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.240
I’d like to have a word with your boss.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.920
What are you planning to do?

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:52.960
I said I’d like to talk to Sia Thep.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:20.000
Boss, MP Phuwish wants to speak with you.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Understood.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.800
(Sia Thep)
Hello, MP Phuwish. What’s this about?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.800
How much does Petchsak owe you?

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.080
(Sia Thep)
(This has nothing to do with you, Mr.MP.)

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.400
(Sia Thep)
(They borrowed money from me, they’ve got to pay me back.)

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.320
I’ll pay the debt for them.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:58.360
Now can you tell me how much they owe you?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.600
(Sia Thep)
(One million baht.)

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.680
One million baht.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:44.320
Phuwish Hatthaniyom, one million baht.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.360
Here’s a cashier’s check for one million.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.120
I’ll leave it with your minions.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.680
Once you’ve got the money..

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.200
Then get the fuck out.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Yes, sir.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.680
And the rest of you, remember this..

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.320
I won’t let you pull this string on anyone else again.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.680
I will wipe out all the courrupting force in the boxing industry!

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.720
Off you go.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.120
Mawin!

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.440
Are you okay?
Mawin!

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.920
Mawin!

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.040
Can you stand?

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.080
Does it hurt?

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.840
Let’s get you patched up first.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.880
I’m really sorry, sir.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.880
You had to step in because of us.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.840
I already told you, you don’t have to call me that.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.320
This is all my fault.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.560
I didn’t take good care of my kids.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.560
Got fooled out of our money.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.800
And when we tried to host an event to pay it back, that fell apart too.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.520
Now you’ve had to step in and pay the debt for us…

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.320
I don’t even know how I’ll pay you back.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.360
Thank you so much.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.440
Uncle Petch, don’t blame yourself.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.800
It’s my fault the event didn’t work out.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.920
It’s okay.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.960
Nobody’s to blame here.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.520
It’s all my fault.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.280
I have to say sorry to you, sir.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.040
Sorry.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.600
I’m sorry.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.440
So sorry.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:14.040
And thank you for everything.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.360
Honestly…

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.200
I actually came here today because I wanted to ask for something.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.520
But after seeing what you’ve all just been through…

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.520
I didn’t want to trouble you.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.160
It’s fine. Please, tell us.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.200
Let us return the favor.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.280
It’s about...

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.040
the Hero Fight event.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.800
As you all know,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.280
it was a dramatic loss.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.800
And I know that wasn’t anyone’s fault.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.280
But I had to cover the damage fee...

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.800
Lost credibility with the insurers, the sponsors, the other gyms.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.760
So I’ll be real with you…

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.560
I’m struggling too.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.760
I’m sorry.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.760
I’m really sorry.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.840
You shouldn’t have gone through any of this.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.200
We’re in the same boat now, aren’t we?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.200
So…

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.080
I want to be part of Petchsak Academy.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.440
Sorry? What do you mean by that?

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.680
No need to apologize, coach Petch.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.880
I...

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.000
Let me be blunt.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.800
I want to buy Petchsak Academy from you.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.600
And in return,

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:44.760
I'll consider that we’re all even now.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.360
Excuse me?

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.880
You don’t have to give me an answer right away.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.120
Think it over.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.760
Why do you want to buy this place?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.080
We’re still small.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.320
We haven’t accomplished anything big yet.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.240
Don’t sell yourself short, Keen.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.720
Petchsak Academy may not be huge.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:29.440
But organizing a fight this well is already impressive.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.240
You should all be proud.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.000
You’ve all done amazing.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.600
You just need an opportunity.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.840
And I’m here to give it to you.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.680
Thank you so much for your kindness, Phuwish.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.200
Really, thank you.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.240
So that means…

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.760
You’ve made a decision?

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.360
Um…

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.560
We’d like to talk it over first.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.880
Of course.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.240
What do we do, Dad?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.200
I don’t know.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.600
Part of me wants to sell, just to be done with all this.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.280
But part of me… I’d hate to see it belong to someone else.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.080
At least Phuwish seems like a good guy.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.560
If he cleared the debt with Sia Thep,

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.720
Maybe the worst is already behind us.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.440
I think selling is a good idea.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.840
It’s the only way out for us.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.560
We can start fresh.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.720
Thun, what do you think?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.600
Coach Petch..

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.320
P. White Tiger Gym has an offer too.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.760
Thun, how are you feeling?

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.160
You doing okay?

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.240
What do you want from me?

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.800
I came because I was worried.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.680
That’s why I came to see you.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.680
You came because you care or because you want to see the damage you’ve done?

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.000
What the hell are you talking about?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.200
I don't know..

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.800
This whole time, you’ve just been trying to get in my way.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.120
Trying to buy Typhoon and poach him from our gym.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.000
Rigging the match against me. And now this, this was you too, wasn’t it?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.680
You think I drugged you?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.160
Hmph, don’t talk when you don’t know anything.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.000
So tell me what you do know.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.680
I…

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.680
I can’t tell you right now.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.200
Again?

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.440
So why are you even here?

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.680
Just to rub it in?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.360
You should leave, I don’t want to see you anymore.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.120
I just want you to know.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.320
I would never hurt you.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.920
I came here today to make you an offer.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.600
I’ll pay off Petchsak Academy’s debts.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:42.480
Everything, from Sia Thep and the money you borrowed from MP Phuwish for the event.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.960
Why would you suddenly want to help us?

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.000
I really can’t explain it right now.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:58.320
But this is the only way I can keep you and everyone safe.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:11.560
Please, just let me do something right as a father.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.040
Why would you even try now? You’re ten years too late.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.360
You fucking suck.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.240
But you’re still my son.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.600
What should we do?

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.520
To be honest.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.560
I feel guilty toward MP Phuwish.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.920
He’s done so much for us already.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.520
I don’t know, Dad.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.000
Whatever I choose, I keep messing up.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I don’t know what to do anymore.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.120
Keen.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.920
What do you think?

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.480
This is important, why are you just telling us now?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.800
I’m sorry.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.600
Everything’s been a mess, I didn’t get the chance.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.160
We need to talk.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.520
Keen.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:13.240
Pakorn, your father, might be messing with your head.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.000
What do you mean by that?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.560
Don’t forget, Pakorn’s the one who rigged the match when you fought Typhoon.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.040
That’s what got Mawin into debt in the first place.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.240
And you were drugged and our whole event falls apart.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.040
Now he shows up to take us over?

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.800
You've been like this since the hospital.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:43.720
You’re mad because I didn’t tell you about my dad, right?

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.720
Well, should I?

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.200
Am I a stranger to you?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.760
I thought we were in this together.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.040
So why didn’t you tell me something that important?

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.200
But I tried to understand.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.320
I figured maybe you had your reason not to tell me.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.600
But I can’t, Thun.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.000
The reason I didn’t tell you… is because I don’t see him as my dad.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.280
Keen, remember what I told you that day?

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:58.520
Pakorn is my father who abandoned me and my mother ten years ago.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:10.480
I think someone like that doesn’t deserved a place in my life

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.480
or in our life.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.240
That’s why I didn’t say anything.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.240
I’m sorry, Keen.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.560
Can you forgive me?

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:47.040
From now on if you ever want to know anything, just ask.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.760
I’ll tell you everything.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.760
Thun, listen carefully.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:13.840
Pakorn… he’s the one who killed my dad.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.920
The way Muay died, it was just like my dad.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.760
But at the crime scene, there were no signs of dogs.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.840
It was like the body had been dumped there.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:58.120
And there was a circular pin left at the scene..

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.640
Pakorn’s pin.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:15.000
Today when he came to see you in the hospital, he wasn’t wearing it.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:34.200
Which means the one at the crime scene was his?

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.880
I’m telling you the truth, Thun.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.280
If you won’t help me…

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.280
I get it.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.200
He’s your father.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:31.840
I know you’re confused and under a lot of stress right now.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.560
So do I.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.640
If he really is what you say he is

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.200
then he has to be held accountable.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.840
And I’ll help you do that.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.320
No matter who’s on the other side.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.120
Thank you, Thun.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.600
I know who drugged you.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.720
Whoa!

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.640
Nice! Ait, you’re amazing!

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.960
Thank you.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.000
Thank you, Coach.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.120
Ait, someone’s calling.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.880
They said it’s urgent, better pick up.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.160
Yes, sir.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.760
(Are you ready to follow the plan, Ait?)

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.960
There’s no other way, is there?

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.400
(Your beloved sister’s still recovering, isn’t she?)

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:40.840
(Don’t forget what I’ve done for you.)

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.840
But Sia…

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.840
(Let’s see what you’ve got to eat today.)

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.320
(Ooh! Shrimp porridge!)

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.360
(Eat up, okay?)

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.400
(If you finish it all, I've got a surprise for you, alright?)

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.080
(Okay!)

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.240
(Here, blow on it first.)

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.320
(Blow, blow, okay?)

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.800
Hey! Ait!

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.160
I saw your fight just now.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.160
You were incredible.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.320
You were the underdog at first,

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.040
but you pushed through and turned it around.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.280
I seriously respect that.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.480
That’s why you’re Petchsak’s

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.520
For real.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.200
Thank you.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.760
Do you need to take a break and grab something to eat or do something else first?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.760
I’ll watch this for you.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.600
Uh, thanks.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.520
Just hold it for a bit.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.960
I’ll go to the restroom and be right back.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.560
Sure.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.280
That’s everything that happened.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.080
How could you do this?
Bung, calm down!

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.960
Bung, don’t!

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.520
Bung, don’t!
Mai, let go!

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.240
You betrayed us.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.920
You ruined the match.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.360
You drugged Thun, he nearly died!

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.080
How do you expect me to stay calm?
Bung, calm down!

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.200
Bung!

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.520
Enough!

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.200
This is a hospital, not the gym.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.080
Who the hell is Sia Thep?

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.040
And how could he do this to us?

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.200
Ait.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.960
Do you know who Sia Thep really is?

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.880
I don’t.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I’ve never met him.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.360
Every time he contacted me, he used a voice changer.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.120
He even managed to get a heart for your sister that fast.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.640
He must have some really powerful connections.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.960
No wonder the cops are scared of him.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.920
Ait, can you at least tell me

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.720
what does he want?

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.760
He only said he wanted to destroy Mr.Phuwish.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.320
We were never the target.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.320
We were just tools.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.240
What do you mean?

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:38.440
He told me to tell Keen to borrow money from Phuwish for the event.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:44.880
Then he told me to drug Thun so the whole thing would collapse.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.360
So Phuwish would lose both his money and reputation.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.440
That was all part of Sia Thep’s plan.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.520
And you helped him?

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.920
Even after everything he’s done for us?

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.280
How could you?

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.680
He had to, Bung.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.520
If it were you, would you let your sister die?

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.120
That’s enough.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.120
You don’t need to protect me.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.000
This is all my fault.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.520
I’m sorry, Coach.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.520
I betrayed you.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.280
I caused you all this trouble.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.440
I’m really sorry.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.520
I’m sorry, Thun.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.960
I almost killed you.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:10.000
Keen, I’m sorry.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.480
I ruined your entire event.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.560
I’m really sorry.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.240
I’m really sorry.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.200
It’s all my fault.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.040
I’m sorry.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.080
I’m sorry…

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.440
I’m so sorry.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.520
Get up.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.720
I’m not mad at you.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.160
I’m not some amazing coach or anything.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.720
I couldn’t even find money or work for you guys.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.920
If you had joined another gym, you might’ve had an easier life.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.760
I know you.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.200
You’re not that kind of person.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:43.120
If you want to come back to our gym, come with me.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.680
I’m not mad at you.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:26.680
But next time, if anything happens, just tell me. Don’t go on your own.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.680
Let’s start over.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.680
Thank you everyone, for giving me another chance.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.720
Thank you.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.520
I’m really sorry.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.000
I'm sorry.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.400
I’m sorry.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.000
You’re in this mess because of me.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.080
You were about to pay off the debt,

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.000
and I ruined it.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.560
I ruined everything.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:13.960
If you hadn’t done what you did, your sister might not have survived, right?

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.360
How could I blame you?

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:32.040
I was the one who got greedy and got into gambling debt in the first place.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.240
But now it’s all over, Ait.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.480
Mr. Phuwish took care of everything for us.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:47:00.760
From now on, let’s start over together.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.200
Thanks.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.080
About the boxing match…

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.720
What are you thanking me for?

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.560
For what you said on stage.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.440
For saying you love me.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:43.760
Thank you for cheering me on and helping me win.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:53.040
And I’m sorry I didn’t say anything back then.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.440
I love you too.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:18.000
But do I really deserve your love?

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.120
I’ll take care of the rest, Coach Petch.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.400
No need to worry.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.000
Thank you so much.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.640
And about Sia Thep, don’t worry.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.640
From now on, I’ll protect everyone myself.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.000
Ah.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.920
Here, take this.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.240
Oh, thanks.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.600
"The Ring Rage"

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.840
Hmm.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.080
When’s the match?

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.920
Tomorrow.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.160
Tomorrow?

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.840
Yes.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.640
Oh.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.920
And I want all the fighters from Petchsak Academy to join.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.000
Alright.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.160
Please get everyone ready.

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:28.000
I’ll send a car to pick you up early tomorrow.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.360
Isn’t that a bit last-minute?

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.360
Hmph. Opportunities don’t come every day, Keen.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.320
We have to be ready when it comes.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.120
That’s just how it is.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.800
Right.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.400
Thank you so much.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:51.400
It’s an honor to have Mr. Phuwish looking after our gym.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.080
Happy to help, Coach Petch.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.320
Oh, your pen.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.080
Thanks.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.320
Whoa? Klao, why are you here?

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.320
Hey, Keen.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.680
I heard Uncle Petch transferred ownership of Petchsak to MP Phuwish.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.240
Is it true?

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.560
Word travels fast, huh?

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.680
Bung told me everything.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.280
From what I’ve seen, Mr. Phuwish seems alright.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.320
Really?

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.200
Didn’t say he was gonna change anything.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.160
He’s even finding us gigs.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.240
We’ve got a match tomorrow.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.880
What match?

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.800
Something called "The Ring Rage" or whatever.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.360
Never heard of it.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.000
"The Ring Rage"?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.560
Have you ever heard of it?

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.920
Not sure, let me look it up real quick.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.040
What was it called again?

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.240
The Ring Rage

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.920
The Ring Rage?

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.400
This one?

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.160
Is it this one?

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.240
What kind of event is that?

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.680
Even the sports news reporter doesn't know?

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.200
Maybe it’s a new event.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.080
Yeah, no…

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.560
I’ve never reported on anything like this before.

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.280
But I’ll go tomorrow.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.120
Mhm.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.440
Actually, I have something important to tell you.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.480
What is it, Klao?

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:55.720
About Pakorn. You said he’s Thun’s dad, right?

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.120
Did I just make you guys fight or something?

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.560
It almost broke us up.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.760
But we’re good now.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.080
That’s good to hear.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.560
If it’s proven that Pakorn really killed Keen’s father…

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.800
I don't...

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.400
I don’t even know how I’m supposed to feel.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.920
Actually, I have a small update about that.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.560
What is it?

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.280
You see this pin?

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.200
The one I was suspicious about and thought it might be Pakorn’s?

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.600
The one found near where Muay’s body was discovered?

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:48.840
Well… I thought Pakorn killed Muay, right?

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:53.480
But actually, the pin might have belonged to Muay herself.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.000
I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions back then.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:06.880
And this pin, it looks like it belongs to some secret organization or something.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.880
Look, all these big names are wearing it.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.680
I think something’s fishy.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.520
Why is this whole thing so complicated, Klao?

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.640
When are we ever going to find out the truth about my dad?

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.080
Hey.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.680
Where are you going?

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.160
I’ve got something to talk about with Pakorn.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.080
No way.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.880
I said no.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.800
Move.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.960
I have something important to discuss with him.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.640
Fighters from other gyms are strictly forbidden. Mr. Pakorn’s orders.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.280
Otherwise, the training secrets might get leaked.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.760
Then go tell him Thun is here to see him.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.600
Hey.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.680
Let Thun go.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.920
Get back to training.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:03.200
Why are you here?

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:09.040
I have something to ask you, but…

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.680
If you won’t say it here, then I don’t say anything at all.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.920
I don’t have all day, you know.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.760
Did you really kill Keen’s father?

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.040
Heh? You came all the way here just to ask me that?

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.200
Fine, I’ll answer you.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.480
But on one condition.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:59.120
Hey, get me some gloves.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.920
Why? Scared?

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.400
Didn’t expect you to be such a coward.

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.000
You think you can just walk in and ask something like that

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.440
and I’ll just answer easily?

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.720
Alright, fine.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.440
Let’s do this.
Come on, then.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.120
Punch!
Kick!

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.360
Careful boss!

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.680
Hey, get him outta here.

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.720
Everyone, let’s go.

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.000
You’re insane.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.760
Hahaha!

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.520
Hey, me first!

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.520
Too late.
Bung, oh man!

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.640
Acting like a clown.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.600
Can you do it?

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.920
Alright.
Let’s go.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:40.920
Thank you.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.520
(THUN: Don’t wait for me. See you at the venue)

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.280
Hey, is everyone ready? The van’s about to leave.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.400
We should get going.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080
Huh?

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.920
You’re not waiting for Thun?

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480
He said to meet him at the venue.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.440
Okay.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.960
We can go then.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.320
Sorry I’m late.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.600
I got caught up dealing with some new product stuff.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.640
Mhm.
Wanna see it?

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.240
Looks rough.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.800
My apologies.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.760
Very good.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.200
Yes, Sia Thep.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.120
Haha!

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:54.320
Please welcome to the boxing ring, Petchsak fighters!

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.640
Typhoon!

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.440
So, why did you bring us here?

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.040
Petchsak Academy is now mine.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.720
You guys are just like my employees.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.440
Thun!

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.440
This Friday, I’m sending you to fight under the name

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.520
Heaven Arena.
