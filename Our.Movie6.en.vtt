I really wanted to run away.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:57.130
Is this all part of your plan too?
Another gutsy move?

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:03.220

Let me just tie this up before I go.

Of course.

Of course.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.138
and shown to the world…

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.228

I even thought…

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.603
Your death might generate publicity…

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.858
And ultimately lead to this film's success.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.466
This was my first chance to direct
in 5 years, and I felt completely lost.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.950
Then you showed up…

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.163
And it eased my mind
because you were the final piece

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.457
that could complete this film.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:08.219
You can blame me. I'll take it.

Don't want this film…

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.712
Can you check how long it takes
to get there by car?

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.880
The hospital? Why?

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.969
Ah, you mean because of that injury?
In case someone else gets hurt?

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.969
Ah, you mean because of that injury?
In case someone else gets hurt?

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.887
Yes. Look into it for me.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.973
- Roger that.
- Okay.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:28.141
Go and eat.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.225
Okay.

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:30.996

THE MISFIT RESTAURANT

What on earth
were you thinking, Lee Daeum?

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.860
[Jeha] Doesn't sound like
a line from our movie.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.290
Mr. Lee, did you sleep well?

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.918
I slept a lot better
than I thought I would. [Chuckles]

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.544
Feels so refreshing.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.341
[Daeum grunts]

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.305
So…

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.350
Are the spots
from yesterday all confirmed?

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.350
Are the spots
from yesterday all confirmed?

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.435
I'm guessing the bookstore is.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.896
The nursing home probably is too.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.189
Is that enough for your meal?

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.528
I just like bread.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.784
Let's go get something to eat.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:30.991
Eat up. Enjoy.

00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:32.265
Eat up. Enjoy.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.269
Thank you.

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.480
Enjoy your meal too.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:40.565
Okay.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:40.565
Okay.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.610
[Hong] Mr. Lee!

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:46.988
An article just dropped.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.740
An article about what?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.206

[Cheolmin] Daeum,

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:05.214
are you ready for this?

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.591
Pardon?

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:09.010
You both look good in the pictures.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:14.098
Still, they could've chosen
a better profile photo for you.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:14.098
Still, they could've chosen
a better profile photo for you.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:18.144
Time to say goodbye
to your quiet life, Daeum.

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.270
[chuckles]

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.147

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.067
Excuse me.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.202
- It'll be all right.
- Okay.

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:41.125

Hey.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.544
What did you do?

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.963
<i>Man, I was so busy
that I couldn't make it there.</i>

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.298
Everything's fine, right?

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.259
I said, what the hell is this?

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.259
I said, what the hell is this?

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.514
Why drop an article like that
out of nowhere?

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.391
<i>Oh, you saw that?</i>

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.437
Hang on, I'll call you later
when I can head down there.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.437
Hang on, I'll call you later
when I can head down there.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.023
Forget it. I'm heading up now.
Let's talk in person.

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.278
[scoffs]

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.870
- Good shot.
- Nice.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.748
It looked like the studio
leaked the info on purpose.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.748
It looked like the studio
leaked the info on purpose.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.084
The photos turned out too pretty
for a rehearsal.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.419
Isn't she the kind of face
film directors love?

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.380
How should I put it?

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.423
Yes, she's got that vibe.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.719
She doesn't even have an agency.
Just a single manager glued to her 24-7.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.179
Word is, the director hired him.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.474
[in English] Nice shot!

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.684
Nice shot!

[in Korean]
Oh, isn't Seoyoung in that movie too?

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.066
Ms. Go, you must've seen this rookie.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.944
I've only said hello to her
a couple of times.

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:51.362
Never seen her properly.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.119

[onlooker chuckles]

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:06.794
Drat.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.303
Daeum!

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.305
Daeum?

00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:20.516
We're about to leave,

00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:20.516
We're about to leave,

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.310
but you don't have a ride.

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.104
Oh, my manager's going to pick me up.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.982
Uh, he's still not sober, I think.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.318
[Daeum] Sorry?

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.318
[Daeum] Sorry?

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.362
Still drunk.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.157
Daeum.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.619
You can ride along with me.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.706
- Pardon?
- You can ride along with me.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.460
Okay.

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.422
[whispers] Is there another ride?

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.049
Is there another ride?

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.051
Hmm?

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:00.389
You can go.

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:00.389
You can go.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:02.933
I'll see you later.

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:07.938
Let's go.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.374
You'll be more comfortable
taking your meds in my car.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:32.088
Clever of you, Mr. Lee.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.384
Things are about to get noisy.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.721
The article.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.721
The article.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.682
Don't worry about that.

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:44.767
I'll handle it like last time.

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.978
If word gets around that a rookie

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.774
is turning down
everyone in the industry left and right,

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.774
is turning down
everyone in the industry left and right,

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.234
it'll just add fuel to the fire.

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.403
Mmm.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.905
[gasps] Oh, then I'll just say this.

00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:01.325
That I'm just waiting to see
how this first movie goes.

00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:01.325
That I'm just waiting to see
how this first movie goes

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.828
to jack up my value as much as I can

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.121
and take my pick of meetings.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.831
That way, people will think,

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:09.875
"She's going to be trouble
if we sign her too fast."

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.169
Sounds good, right?

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.551
[Daeum clears throat]

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.555
[sighs] I'm feeling really sleepy
all of a sudden.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.555
[sighs] I'm feeling really sleepy
all of a sudden.

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:25.683
Let me nap for a bit.

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.435
Wake me up when we get there.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.240
Because I'm not someone who exists
to act the way you want or predict.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.240
Because I'm not someone who exists
to act the way you want or predict.

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:43.760
That's something you should expect
from someone who loves you.

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:44.785
Not me.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:47.705

Go ahead.

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:00.134
So, what's this about?

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:00.134
So, what's this about?

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:04.305
I heard a lot about you from Seoyoung.
She says you're very close.

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:05.973
Ah. [Chuckles]

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:07.349
Yes, we are.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.603
I'm so excited
to be working with her on this movie.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.603
I'm so excited
to be working with her on this movie.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.730
I've heard a lot about you, too, Ms. Go.

- [coos]
- [both chuckle]

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:25.951
I hear there's someone else you know
in <i>Love in White</i>.

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:27.995
Yes, there is. Lee Daeum.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:29.789
Are you two friends?

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:32.875
Not exactly, but we know each other well.

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:32.875
Not exactly, but we know each other well.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.084
Oh.

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:38.714
I'm very interested in Daeum,

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.341
so I wanted some information.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.341
So I wanted some information.

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:42.927
Are you saying

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:46.639
you asked to meet me
just to ask about Daeum?

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:48.015
Yes, that's right.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:49.934
Why me, though?

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:53.354
That Daeum is
a tough one to get through to.

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:57.775
I thought it might help to get some info
before trying to approach her again.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.486
You went to college together, no?

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.596
You went to college together, no?

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:02.530
We did.

00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:08.494
Hi.

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:11.664
GPA: 2.5, GRADE: B

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.335
What about you, Daeum?

00:22:17.628 --> 00:22:19.046
[clears throat]

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.257
GPA: 4.5, GRADE: A+

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.591
An A+, huh?

00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:28.264
Well, Daeum did carry the whole thing.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.099
Of course, she got an A+.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.099
Of course, she got an A+.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.602
You didn't even come to rehearsals
because of your shoot.

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.521
[Jaein] <i>But…</i>

00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:38.524
She disappeared after just one semester
without telling anyone.

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:41.610
She made a real impact
in that one semester, though.

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:41.610
She made a real impact
in that one semester, though.

00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:43.904
She got a reputation
for being a good actress.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.615
The professors liked her,

00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:48.993
and her classmates and upperclassmen

00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:50.411
all liked her too.

00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:50.411
All liked her too.

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:51.620
Mmm.

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.164
A social butterfly, so to speak?

00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:56.166
All the more interesting [sucks teeth]

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.879
someone like that having a long absence
and no background info. Isn't it?

00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:01.881
Actually,

00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:03.924
I saw something else in her.

00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:05.718
Mmm. You did?

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:07.428
You're curious, right?

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:09.722
[chuckles]

00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:14.226
If you figure that out, I think
you might be able to get through to her.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.312
Mmm. So let me hear it.

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:18.856
I think I'll stop here for today.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:21.400
I know you very well, Ms. Go.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:21.400
I know you very well, Ms. Go.

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:23.944
I think we're cut from the same cloth.

00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:25.487
The same cloth?

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.282
Is there anything
you want to know about me?

00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:35.873
Goodbye…

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:40.878
[Ms. Go chuckles]

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:40.878
[Ms. Go chuckles]

00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:42.963
I'm not sure.

00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:46.383
I've never really thought
about bringing you in.

00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:49.011
I'm not even curious about you.

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:53.724
I'm looking for a lead actress
with real appeal.

00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:54.892
Like Lee Daeum.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.561
[♪ Pensive piano music playing]

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.567
[Minhee] <i>They definitely started off</i>
<i>talking about Daeum,</i>

00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:06.654
<i>but I can't figure out
what the context was.</i>

00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:08.280
Hmm.

00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:11.700
Jaein looked totally rattled when she left.

00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:11.700
Jaein looked totally rattled when she left.

00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:14.620
Thanks for telling me, Minhee.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:17.665
But also…

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.042
Yes, Ms. Chae?

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.042
Yes, Ms. Chae?

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.169
You're getting better at this.

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:24.630
I'll keep

00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:25.798
I'll keep working hard.

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.473
[knocks on door]

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:35.557
Come in.

00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:57.246
Dr. Lee, I never got
to properly say hello last time.

00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:00.416
Right.

00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:00.416
Right.

00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:06.463
Well, then…

00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:08.966
How have you been?

00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:13.053
Just trying to survive.

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:15.014
That's all.

00:25:15.597 --> 00:25:16.598
Sure.

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:20.811
What brings you to the hospital?

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:20.811
What brings you to the hospital?

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:22.271
Are you unwell?

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:25.399
You know she only ever relied on you
while she was alive.

00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:27.651
So I just came to see you.

00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.320
And there's something.

00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.320
And there's something.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.948
I really wanted to say to you.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.411
Dr. Lee.

00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:41.040
I have not been well.

00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:41.040
I have not been well.

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:48.088
Go on in.

00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:49.298
If anything happens

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:50.466
I'll call you right away.

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:50.466
I'll call you right away.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.594
From now on,
I'll get updates through Junbyung.

00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:54.970
Reach out to him instead.

00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:56.597
Okay.

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:59.224
Thank you. [Chuckles]

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:01.477
Bye.

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.827
That was harsh, Lee Jeha.

00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:22.372
Had to open your big mouth, huh?

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:24.166
What kind of an answer

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:26.418
Lee Daeum, you idiot.

00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:27.503
Come on.

00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:32.633
[groans]

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.930
Okay,

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:39.890
then let's start with the kiss.

00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.600
Whether it's a kiss or confession,

00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.600
Whether it's a kiss or confession,

00:26:41.683 --> 00:26:43.977
how the other person acts afterwards
says everything.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.687
But…

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:48.148
The things that he supposedly said

00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:50.025
just make it confusing.

00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:50.025
Just make it confusing.

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:52.194
I heard he didn't seem to hate it,

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:54.863
but drew a clear line
when it came to the confession.

00:26:54.947 --> 00:26:56.490
How do you know this person?

00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:58.534
From the crew?

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:00.994
Yes, it's a crew member.

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:00.994
Yes, it's a crew member.

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:05.207
[groans] What are they doing at work?
I'm jealous.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.751
Hey, this is a serious situation here.

00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:09.002
Can you focus?

00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:12.673
So, apparently the one
who kissed and confessed first.

00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:12.673
So, apparently the one
who kissed and confessed first

00:27:12.756 --> 00:27:14.007
isn't usually like that.

00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:16.051
She's usually very rational and...

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:19.388
Hey, who kisses and confesses
based on rational thinking?

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.224
Oh.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.271
Does that mean she really likes him?

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:29.147
Is that why she felt hurt?

00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:30.274
She felt hurt?

00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:30.274
She felt hurt?

00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:31.859
Yeah.

00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:33.819
Hurt to the point of tears.

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.821
Hang on.

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.198
Do you have someone there?

00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:39.741
What?

00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:42.160
Look in the mirror.
You look very hurt right now.

00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:42.160
Look in the mirror.
You look very hurt right now.

00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:45.080
Hey, I told you it wasn't me.

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:47.541
How can someone like me like someone?

00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:50.752
Listen to me, Daeum.

00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:50.752
Listen to me, Daeum.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.506
Everyone dies.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.009
Before that, we get old.
Before that, we're young.

00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:59.177
We screw up, we cause trouble,

00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:01.179
fall for random people,
kiss them, regret it.

00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:01.179
Fall for random people,
kiss them, regret it.

00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:04.016
That's what we do.

00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.604
Where's that fearless,
nothing-to-lose Daeum

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:09.813
I used to know?

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:13.358
Hey! I told you it's not me.

Okay.

00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:38.258
I'll arrange a meeting later.

00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:40.135
Okay.

00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:40.135
Okay.

00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:53.398
Hey, I wanted to trust you and wait, too,

00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:56.193
but the whole mystery thing?

00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:57.694
That's not the trend anymore.

00:28:57.778 --> 00:28:59.112
She's our star.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.238
She needs to be seen.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.238
She needs to be seen.

00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:02.282
This is going to stir things up.

00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:03.867
It won't stop with Ms. Go.

00:29:03.951 --> 00:29:05.551
Everyone will start chasing after Daeum,

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:06.828
and if we keep declining…

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:11.750
They might start dragging her name
through the mud.

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:11.750
They might start dragging her name
through the mud.

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.085
Yeah, that's nothing new.

00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:17.422
You've been making a big deal
out of small things lately, you know?

00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:21.385
And why would a director
even worry about that?

00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:21.385
And why would a director
even worry about that?

00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:23.220
That's not your responsibility.

00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:26.723
I want to push back all promo and exposure
until we finish filming.

00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:30.060
And cancel the photo shoot
we talked about last time too.

00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:30.060
And cancel the photo shoot
we talked about last time too.

00:29:30.143 --> 00:29:31.144
[Seungwon] Hey, Jeha.

00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:33.522
Now you're really pushing your luck.

00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:38.151
What, did I plaster Daeum's personal info
in the middle of downtown?

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:40.028
All I did was post one rehearsal photo!

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:40.028
All I did was post one rehearsal photo!

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.949
And another photo with you, yeah.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.829
I said this kind of promo isn't necessary.

00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:51.039
You'll get everything you need later...

00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:51.039
You'll get everything you need later...

00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:52.666
Get what?

00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:56.294
Just let me do my job. I need to focus.

00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:58.422
Let me just make this film, okay?

00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:06.722
I'm not going to let this movie ruin me.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.765
I'm not going to ruin this movie either.

00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:14.896
I'm probably more desperate than you are
for this film to succeed.

00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:19.526
[Gyoyeong exclaims]

00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:21.194
Thanks, Gyo.

00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:21.194
Thanks, Gyo.

00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:22.738
- That's yours, Daeum.
- Looks tasty.

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.421
I was hoping it'd just be the two of us.

00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:29.828
Oh, I didn't know. [Chuckling] Sorry.

00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.831
No need to be sorry, though.

00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:35.083
I'm leaving anyway.

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.045
See? I got it to go.

00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:39.921
You two are still inseparable, huh?

00:30:41.298 --> 00:30:43.341
Does that mean you lied, Gyoyeong?

00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:46.094
What are you talking about?

00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:48.513
When Daeum disappeared.

00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:50.682
You said you didn't know where she was.

00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:50.866
You said you didn't know where she was.

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:52.350
That's what people told me.

00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:53.435
[stutters]

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:55.062
Gyoyeong didn't know back then either.

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.856
I just took a leave without telling anyone.

00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:02.360
Why are you all salty and nosy about it?

00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:02.360
Why are you all salty and nosy about it?

besides the audition.

How so?

As Daeum needs to eat more frequently
than others to maintain energy,

be entirely built around her treatment.

she could suddenly
go into a seizure during filming.

Before her clinical trial,

00:42:46.022 --> 00:42:48.357
I was so full of hope and excitement.

00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:52.612
But Minjeong kept staring out the window.

00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:55.990
Always saying she wanted to go outside.

00:42:57.575 --> 00:42:59.660
I asked what she'd even do outside,

00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:02.163
and it was nothing special.

00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:06.485
She said she just wanted to
walk around like everyone else.

00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.128
I didn't even

00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:11.464
try to listen to her at all.

00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:11.464
Try to listen to her at all.

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.474
I only cared about

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.474
I only cared about

00:43:23.226 --> 00:43:24.852
keeping my kid alive one more day.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.980
Looking back, I regret it so much.

00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:31.984
It was all me being selfish.

00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:34.570
Ma'am

00:43:34.654 --> 00:43:35.655
Dr. Lee.

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:38.658
Let Daeum

00:43:40.076 --> 00:43:41.869
do what she wants to do.

<i>You still have the chance
to do what's right.</i>

00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:57.927
Travel time on weekday mornings
is usually two and a half hours.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:01.222
Anyone driving or taking a van
instead of the bus,

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:01.222
Anyone driving or taking a van
instead of the bus,

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.558
please drive safely.

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:04.851
Also, we do have

00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:08.104
full support and permits
from the city during our shoot,

00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:10.356
but please don't forget your manners!

00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:10.356
But please don't forget your manners!

00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:12.400
Especially you smokers.

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.027
If you're not going to
toss your butts properly,

00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:16.445
just bring your vape.

00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:18.447
Bring! Your! Vape!

Please make sure of that.

Okay, uh,
I know the schedule's been pretty tight.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.128
Thank you for your hard work.
We're really starting soon.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.128
Thank you for your hard work.
We're really starting soon.

00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:34.422
It's only going to get tighter,

00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:37.300
so let's all take care of ourselves first.

00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:39.343
BONE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:42.054
We can't have anyone
breaking any bones on set, right?

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:42.054
We can't have anyone
breaking any bones on set, right?

00:44:42.138 --> 00:44:44.182
Everyone take one of these before you go.

[♪ Upbeat pop song playing]

00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:49.812
Now, Director Lee.

00:44:49.896 --> 00:44:51.063
Say "ah."

Say "ah."

No, I'm good.

Yeah, it's all about
taking care of ourselves.

Ah. Hey, Hong. The other thing.

Ah. Hey, Hong. The other thing.

Oh, of course.

00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:04.285
There's one more announcement.

00:45:05.578 --> 00:45:07.205
Mr. Bu is treating all of us

Wow, bone health and a free dinner?

What about the actors?

00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:33.272
They'll head over with the makeup crew
once their test is done.

[Daeum] No, it's not.

because I was abroad.

I don't think so.

You're supposed to get even paler
later in the movie.

You're supposed to get even paler

[stammers] Ms. Jo,

00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:49.557
I got so nervous, I'm starving.

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:52.935
Mind if I grab a quick bite
and hit the bathroom?

00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:54.103
Sure, go ahead.

00:46:54.603 --> 00:46:58.816
Though I just made you look all fragile.
The snack might ruin that.

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:02.236
No, please eat.

What kind of pills are these?

Diet pills?

00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:35.061
Just vitamins.
They work better after meals.

Totally something
Gyuwon would carry, right?

Hello, I'm Jeong Eunho.

I'll be fine. Go ahead and drink.
I can just grab a cab later.

He says this now, but back in Gangwon-do…

Why don't you take a drink first, Ms. Yu?

Why don't you take a drink first, Ms. Yu?

00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:07.565
So how did the director's friend
end up managing Daeum?

00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:10.442
I've always wanted to work
on a film set at least once.

00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:10.442
I've always wanted to work
on a film set at least once.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.361
Why?

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:14.947
Admiration, I guess?

00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:16.615
You know, it's romantic.

00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:19.702
The actors, managers, and crew

00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:22.079
All coming together for one project.

00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:27.001
Who knew our dear manager
had a romantic side? [Chuckles]

00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:29.587
Excuse me for a bit.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.005
I need some fresh air.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.005
I need some fresh air.

00:51:31.714 --> 00:51:32.756
I might as well drink.

00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:40.806
Oh, there he goes again.

00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:40.806
Oh, there he goes again.

00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:42.933
Catch you later.

00:51:47.313 --> 00:51:48.689
It's been a while, Hong.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.821
I'm on a diet.

00:51:56.405 --> 00:51:58.240
I think eating would help more

00:51:58.324 --> 00:52:00.200
with your diet than alcohol.

00:51:58.324 --> 00:52:00.200
With your diet than alcohol.

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:04.413
If you skip the snacks,
you can drink tons and not gain a pound.

00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:06.040
[chuckles]

00:52:06.624 --> 00:52:08.542

[Seungwon] Ah, our Ms. Jo here
is always full of charm.

00:52:12.588 --> 00:52:14.715
Ms. Jo, do you have a boyfriend?

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.300
Why would I bother with one of those?

00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:19.178
Wow, so cool. [Gasps]

00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:21.180
That means we're all single here.

00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:21.180
That means we're all single here.

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.932
[coughing]

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.685
I'm sorry. [Chuckles]

00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:28.270
Back to the point.

00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:29.332
Sure, love happens.

00:52:29.356 --> 00:52:30.356
Sure, love happens.

00:52:30.439 --> 00:52:32.566
And then the woman dies.

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.526
That's when it got interesting for me.

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:35.611
The man

00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:37.363
is total trash.

00:52:37.946 --> 00:52:39.448
Just nonstop trash.

00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:41.158
But that's real life.

00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:42.951
This movie's basically a documentary.

00:52:43.035 --> 00:52:44.703
It happened to me too.

00:52:44.787 --> 00:52:49.249
Well, to say that's what
real life and real love is

00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:50.501
I don't think I agree.

00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:50.501
I don't think I agree.

00:52:51.418 --> 00:52:53.587
Yes, our DP here said that famous line.

00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:56.048
"That's not <i>Love in White,</i>
that's <i>Love in Black</i>."

00:52:56.131 --> 00:52:57.508
[chuckling]

00:52:57.591 --> 00:52:59.426
He's such a romantic.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.095
<i>Love in Black</i>! Nailed it.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.095
<i>Love in Black</i>! Nailed it.

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:02.721
It's totally dark.

00:53:03.555 --> 00:53:05.641
So you're on Team Original Story?

00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:06.892
Yes, I am.

00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:08.310
That's a total fantasy.

00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:11.105
Textbook love.
Nowhere to be seen around us.

00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:11.105
Textbook love.
Nowhere to be seen around us.

00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:15.693
Just because it's not around you
doesn't mean it's not out there.

00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:18.237
[Junbyung] Yes, you're too cynical.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.697
He knows she's dying,

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.657
but he still loves her so much

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.657
but he still loves her so much

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.867
that he comes back to her.
That's what's meaningful.

00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:26.370
T-That's what's romantic, isn't it?

00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:29.289
[laughs]

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:32.751
It's way more fun
when the man just uses the woman,

00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:35.838
never comes back, and ends up in ruins
like a piece of trash.

00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:38.424
This film's going to be a hit for sure.

00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:41.176
If people are already debating the ending,

00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:41.176
If people are already debating the ending,

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.512
that means it's got plenty to chew on.

00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:45.848
I need to use the restroom.

00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:47.808
Okay.

00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:52.646
The other day, I noticed…

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.316
No, never mind.

00:53:56.817 --> 00:53:58.444
Come on, don't leave us hanging.

00:53:58.527 --> 00:53:59.528
Exactly.

00:54:02.489 --> 00:54:03.615
There's something…

00:54:05.784 --> 00:54:07.119
Between Mr. Lee and Daeum, right?

00:54:07.745 --> 00:54:08.912
- What?
- What?

00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:11.957
Why?

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.041
Did you see something?

00:54:13.625 --> 00:54:15.461
Oh, please, you know exactly what I mean.

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.797
I'm just saying this
because I'm worried, okay?

00:54:18.881 --> 00:54:22.634
Mr. Lee's young. Daeum's even younger.
The way the two look at each other

00:54:18.881 --> 00:54:22.634
Mr. Lee's young. Daeum's even younger.
The way the two look at each other…

00:54:25.387 --> 00:54:27.139
[laughs]

00:54:27.222 --> 00:54:28.557
Lee Jeha? In love?

00:54:29.475 --> 00:54:31.935
That guy doesn't do love at all. [Laughs]

00:54:29.475 --> 00:54:31.935
That guy doesn't do love at all. [Laughs]

00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:35.355
- I'm sorry.
- What's up with this dude?

00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:37.649
Got a lighter?

00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:44.406
I'm all right.

00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:48.076
You've had a lot to drink.
Are you all right?

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.206
Actually, Mr. Ji.

00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:55.000
I called you out here

00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:57.169
because I had something to say.

00:54:58.086 --> 00:54:59.171
What is it?

00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:00.923
On our previous movie shoot,

00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:00.923
On our previous movie shoot,

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.675
Dasol, who worked
under me for three years,

00:55:04.927 --> 00:55:07.471
got caught up
in a messy love triangle on set

00:55:07.554 --> 00:55:08.805
and ran off.

00:55:08.889 --> 00:55:11.016
We couldn't find anyone to replace her,

00:55:08.889 --> 00:55:11.016
We couldn't find anyone to replace her,

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:13.393
and it nearly derailed the whole project.

00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:15.604
These kids are in their prime.

00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:18.732
Their careers can't get destroyed
because of stuff like that.

00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:22.611
Well, I agree that it shouldn't happen,

00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:22.611
Well, I agree that it shouldn't happen,

00:55:22.694 --> 00:55:25.155
but why are you bringing this up with me?

00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:27.449
You're the head of the camera crew.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.035
[laughs]

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.035
[laughs]

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.163
I mean…

00:55:34.206 --> 00:55:35.249
Why are you laughing?

00:55:35.958 --> 00:55:38.043
Come on, Ms. Jo...

00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:39.795
This isn't a laughing matter.

00:55:40.462 --> 00:55:43.215
One wrong move
and the whole shoot could fall apart.

00:55:43.298 --> 00:55:45.425
This is a really serious issue,

00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:47.094
and you're laughing?

00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:50.556
Well, I…

00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:50.556
Well, I…

00:55:51.515 --> 00:55:52.516
Oh, dear.

00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:56.311
I understand. I'll keep an eye on my crew.

00:55:56.395 --> 00:55:57.521
Sure. So take this.

00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:58.647
This!

00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:01.525
This is what I'm talking about! Stop it!

00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:01.525
This is what I'm talking about! Stop it!

00:56:01.608 --> 00:56:03.443
Your guys must've
learned this stuff from you!

00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.612
Taking care of people in subtle ways!

00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:06.776
Inside is a few steps away,

00:56:06.822 --> 00:56:08.949
so why are you
taking your coat off for me here?

00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:10.826
Well…

00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:10.826
Well…

00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:13.245
- You seemed cold.
- [scoffs]

00:56:14.663 --> 00:56:15.914
[gasps]

00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:20.919
- Mr. Ji…
- Yes?

00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:20.919
- Mr. Ji…
- Yes?

00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:22.212
- Gosh, what do I do?
- Huh?

00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:23.505
Don't look at this.

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:25.048
Is that…

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.678
Did it leave a hole? [Gasps]

00:56:29.761 --> 00:56:32.139
Goodness. It got a spot right there.

00:56:29.761 --> 00:56:32.139
Goodness. It got a spot right there.

00:56:33.265 --> 00:56:35.058
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

00:56:35.142 --> 00:56:36.143
Oh, well…

00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:39.354
This looks quite nice.

00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:49.656
[Jeha] <i>We're about to start shooting.</i>

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.035
If your condition worsens, 70 or 80 people
will have to stop everything.

DAD

00:57:08.447 --> 00:57:10.636
DAD

00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:16.558
Hey, Dad.

00:57:17.684 --> 00:57:18.894
Hey.

00:57:18.977 --> 00:57:19.978
Where are you?

00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:21.104
[Daeum stammers]

00:57:22.606 --> 00:57:24.358
I had a makeup test today.

00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:28.320
And now all the cast and crew
are having dinner together.

00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:30.489
Is that so?

00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:30.489
Is that so?

00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:32.199
[stutters]

00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:34.660
W-Why did you call?

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.872
Come to the hospital when you're free.

00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:43.001
We need to check you
before the shoot begins.

00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:43.001
We need to check you

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:06.566
That's one hell of a sigh.

00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:11.697
Long time no see, Daeum.

00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:11.697
Long time no see, Daeum.

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:22.332
It's been a while, Eunho.

00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:28.505
I didn't know you were still acting.

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:30.507
I didn't know.

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:30.507
I didn't know.

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.403
As well as meeting again like this.

00:58:33.427 --> 00:58:34.928
I was surprised too.

00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:36.972
You're on the camera crew?

00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:40.350
I prefer being behind the camera
rather than in front of it.

00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:40.350
I prefer being behind the camera
rather than in front of it.

00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:42.269
Mmm.

Honestly,

00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:50.527
that article about you really shocked me.

That article about you really shocked me.

00:58:51.695 --> 00:58:52.738
You just…

00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:55.407
Completely disappeared back then.

00:58:58.577 --> 00:58:59.578
Could you…

00:59:01.288 --> 00:59:02.998
Tell me now

00:59:04.458 --> 00:59:05.500
why you had to…

00:59:07.627 --> 00:59:09.296
Do that back then?

00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:13.508
Daeum.

00:59:14.259 --> 00:59:15.635
There you are.

Mr. Lee.

00:59:20.015 --> 00:59:21.099
Hello, Mr. Lee.

00:59:21.683 --> 00:59:22.768
I'm Jeong Eunho.

00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:26.021
Yes, the new camera team member.

00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:27.105
Yes.

00:59:29.316 --> 00:59:31.526
You two seem to know each other.

00:59:29.316 --> 00:59:31.526
You two seem to know each other.

00:59:33.862 --> 00:59:34.982
We went to college together.

00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:37.824
I see, you know each other from college.

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.994
Can we talk for a bit, Daeum?

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.994
Can we talk for a bit, Daeum?

00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:43.747
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:48.877
Sorry, Eunho. Let's talk more later.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.045
Hang on.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.045
Hang on.

00:59:50.921 --> 00:59:52.506
You changed your number, right?

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:56.802
Can you give me that one?

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:04.976
Okay. I'll be in touch.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.478
Okay.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.283
You two must've been pretty close.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.283
You two must've been pretty close.
