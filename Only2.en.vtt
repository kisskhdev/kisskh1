WEBVTT

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.920
Thank you so much for helping me today.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.560
<i>Her name's Tawan. She's in Grade 12.</i>

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.520
<i>The school's best kendo athlete.</i>

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.120
No!

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.720
Tawan!

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.000
<i>Don't ever forget who you are.</i>

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880
<i>Keep chasing your dreams.</i>

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.480
I'll always be rooting for you.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.360
<i>She didn't tell you?</i>

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.160
<i>She's transferred schools.</i>

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.960
<i>And when that day comes,</i>

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.600
<i>you'll see me again.</i>

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400
<i>And I'm going to get you back, Tawan.</i>

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.240
Hi, everyone. It's Ayla!

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.040
Today, I'll be unboxing
some gifts from my fans.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.920
Let's start with the first one.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.120
Oh my God.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.280
You guys, it's a collectible!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.920
AYLA

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.600
Wait!

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.080
This box has a rose in it too.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.040
Let's take a closer look.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.720
AYLA

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.520
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.840
Guys…

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.520
I think the staff are messing with me.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.440
Must be Halloween coming up soon.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.360
Right.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.000
I don't want an apology.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.920
I want to know where Ayla's safety stands.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.720
How did your staff
let someone like that get through?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.960
Wasn't there any kind of screening?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.000
<i>We're currently looking into</i>

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.280
how that box ended up
mixed in with Ayla's fan gifts.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.920
The staff organizing them said
they'd never seen that box before.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.000
So, basically,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.160
anyone can just walk into your studio?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.800
Anyone can stroll into your company

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.560
whenever they want?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.840
No, that's not the case.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.920
We have security stationed at all times.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.560
Clearly not enough.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.560
This isn't the first time
something's happened to Ayla.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.120
Your president promised me

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.920
her safety would always come first.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
That's the only reason
I let her sign with your label.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.080
Mr. Thana,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.560
we'll assign extra security
to Ayla immediately.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.080
I don't want it.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.640
I no longer trust your company.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.440
Dad.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.200
I'll find a personal bodyguard
for my daughter myself.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.840
That's it.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.880
Dad.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.840
You don't have to be mad.
Nothing really happened.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.680
I was just a little shaken.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.760
This isn't a joke.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.120
You've already received
too many disturbing gifts.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.560
Get me a list and profiles
of bodyguard agencies.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.960
I'm choosing one
for my daughter personally.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.720
Dad, actually,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.360
I know one agency.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.640
They've got a great track record.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.760
They protect international artists

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.640
and even global leaders
when they're in Thailand.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.040
Quite impressive. Want to check them out?

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.160
Stay back!

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.360
Clear!

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.240
Clear!

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.920
Keep down!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.040
Go!

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.720
Mission complete!

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.280
You were three minutes late.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.600
Come on, boss.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.960
It's Tim's fault. He wouldn't go down.
Wasted a ton of ammo.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.200
Or maybe your skills are slipping?
Missing your shots?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.720
I hit him, okay? Just grazed him.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.920
At least the mission was a success.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.720
But does anyone know what went wrong
that cost us those three minutes?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.720
My side and Chanya's
hit all targets, boss.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.080
Yeah, but the hostage got injured.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.520
What happened? What's wrong with your leg?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.840
I rushed down the stairs
and twisted my ankle.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440
Oh…

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.000
That explains it. I noticed
she slowed down right after that.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.760
Sorry about that.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.120
Go ice it right away.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.680
Nana, take care of it.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.760
Yes, boss. This way, please.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.560
Boss, what did I mess up on?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.160
How did Tim manage to fight back?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.000
Instead of disarming
your opponent quickly,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.520
you hesitated.
Gave him an opening to counter.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.280
When did he even have a chance?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.680
Tim.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.360
Boss, a new assignment came in
via email a minute ago.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.200
Chanya, help Nana handle it.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.480
On it, boss.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.880
Class C…

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.840
PERSONAL PROFILE

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.320
EXECUTIVE PROTECTION

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.880
Still not quite right.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.200
Not quite right yet.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.280
PERSONAL PROFILE

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.640
This set isn't it either.
Are there more to choose from?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.360
Here.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.640
Are there any more options?

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.360
Right.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.520
But the next batch is Class A.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.720
Then this better be it.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.880
PERSONAL PROFILE

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.560
Still not feeling it.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.800
May I?

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.120
Don't tell me…

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.480
Yup. No one has been picked.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.800
What do we do now?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.040
None of them made the VIP cut?

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.440
Not even Class A?

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.600
That's right, boss.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.720
That's why Chanya's sulking right now.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.920
Nana,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.520
set up a meeting with the VIP.
I'll talk to her myself.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.560
Got it, boss.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.680
MUTUAL TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.240
Is that really
all your agency has to offer?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.680
From what I've heard,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.640
from Class C to Class A,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.120
none of our bodyguards
meet your VIP's criteria.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.360
So, we'll take full responsibility

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.760
and cancel the contract.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.000
I don't think we'll be needing
a new agency after all, Dad.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.240
Then,

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.160
how are you going to have a bodyguard?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.600
You didn't choose anyone.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.640
I've made my choice.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.400
Ms. Rawee, would you be my bodyguard?

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.040
Or is Ms. Bodyguard too scared
to take care of me?

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.360
If that's what Ms. Ayla wants,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.400
our company is happy
to provide the service.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.920
And I'm happy

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.560
to be taken care of by someone top-tier.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.560
How about starting tomorrow?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.800
Well,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.320
don't you think we should hire
two or three bodyguards instead?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.320
One doesn’t seem like enough.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.320
One's all I need.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.920
Pleasure working with you,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.080
Ms. Bodyguard.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.320
Let's go.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.360
See? Told you. That's my boss!

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.040
Handled the VIP like it was nothing.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.400
No issues, right?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.240
She canceled the old deal herself,
and we didn't lose anything, right?

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.720
Let's discuss this at the office.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800
TERMINATION LETTER

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.640
Uh… Boss? The termination letter
hasn't been signed.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.480
What? Why--

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.600
See you tomorrow,

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.000
Tawan.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.080
She didn't cancel the contract…

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.480
See you tomorrow…

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.240
So, we got the job?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.680
- Boss!
- So, this means--

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.800
Quiet.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.040
We'll talk at the office.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.960
She's a famous idol!

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.160
You've never seen her on TV?

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.600
Yes?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.360
She waved!

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.200
I'm going after her.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.960
- Wait. Is she leaving?
- Let's go!

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.080
Oh?

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.680
Who left the door open?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.720
INDIVIDUALS RELATED TO THE VIP

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.440
MISS CHANITTHA NAMWONG
"KAEW" - MAID

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.600
Don't you all have something to do?

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.000
No, ma'am.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.040
Mission briefing, please!

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.120
You saw the VIP, didn't you?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.160
That's the job. Simple as that.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.360
But you don't usually take celebrity gigs.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.320
I was the only one left. The VIP
made her choice. Was I supposed to say no?

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.520
Does she know you or something?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.680
She called you "Tawan".

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.000
Right. If we knew you two had a history,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.360
I'd have had you speak with her
from the start.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.040
We met a long time ago.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.640
We're not close.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.240
I think she wants to be.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.360
That sweet smile she gave you…

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.320
Boss did this for the company.
Right, Nana?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.040
Absolutely.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.360
Boss, Ms. Ayla is really pretty, you know?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.400
Could I maybe…

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.319
get her autograph?

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.240
Or maybe not.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.839
I mean, she's seriously beautiful.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.480
Gorgeous, sexy, can sing and dance…

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.880
No wonder she's got stalkers.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.960
Boss,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.359
I've sent you all of Ms. Ayla's songs,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.880
just in case it helps when talking to her.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.840
Why though?

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.160
Why does our boss
need to listen to her music?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.560
We're bodyguards, not her fans!

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.760
- Exactly!
- Oh, come on--

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.800
It's fine.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.480
Good to have background info.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.160
Mr. Teru Teru Bōzu…

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.040
Do you think
Tawan's still as sweet as before?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.440
Do you think she has someone?

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.320
But she's not wearing a ring on
either hand. So, maybe she's still single.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.840
Right?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.040
Ms. Rawee, would you be my bodyguard?

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.400
Morning, Tawan.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.200
Good morning, Ms. Ayla.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.920
Can I ask something?

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.120
Of course.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.560
If it's within my ability,
I'd be happy to.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.200
Could you talk to me

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.400
a little more casually?
This feels way too formal.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.160
Oh, and one more thing.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.800
I don't really like people gossiping about

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.400
how I have a personal bodyguard
following me around all the time.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.520
So…

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.800
You'd like me to dress in plain clothes?

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.880
Uh-huh.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.720
Understood.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.240
Wow…

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.440
So professional. No wonder you're S-rank.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.120
We also have some additional rules

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.880
for you, Ms. Ayla.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.560
RULE NO. 3

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.160
The last one…

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.120
"You must stay within visual range

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.360
of your bodyguard at all times."

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.240
Visual range?

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.680
And what exactly is "visual range"?

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.120
Like this?

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.760
Or maybe this?

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560
Or this?

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.280
Can you see me now?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.920
Please sign to acknowledge the rules.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.800
Got a pen?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.680
THE PRINCIPAL

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.040
DANCE AND PERFORMANCE CLUB

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.440
Super pinky promise!

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.280
DANCE AND PERFORMANCE CLUB

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.240
Super pinky promise.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.200
THE BODYGUARD

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.520
I'll go put this away,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.440
then we can head to the office.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.000
Yes, Ms. Ayla.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.800
Just Ayla.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.960
Call me Ayla, like before?

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.800
I don't think that would be appropriate,
Ms. Ayla.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.880
Rule 27.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.600
Follow the VIP's instructions,
unless it's life-threatening.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.200
Calling me Ayla isn't exactly
life-threatening, right, Tawan?

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.040
Alright then.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.440
Ayla.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.760
Hello, Ayla!

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.080
Hello!

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.000
Yam, how are you?

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.440
I'm great.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.720
Missed you!

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.160
See you later.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.120
Goodbye.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.320
Go ahead.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.080
Hello, boss?

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.080
What is it, Chanya?

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.720
Just a moment.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.520
Huh?

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.680
Is everything alright?

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.760
Excuse me. Can you turn around for a sec?

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.400
Try posing like this.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.440
And can you do a voice like this?

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.800
Well, would you be interested
in auditioning tomorrow?

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.720
No, thank you.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.800
Why not?

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.800
You're so pretty, great figure.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.920
Perfect for being an artist.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.960
If it's about singing,

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.000
don't worry, we can train you.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.040
I'm here to look after Ms. Ayla.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.040
Wait, did we hire someone to guard Ayla?

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.600
Why didn't I know?

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.480
I don't think so.
I'll have to check with Tik.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.440
Tell Tik to find someone else.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.440
As for this beautiful lady,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.120
I'm signing her to debut.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.680
Huh? Debut?

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.920
Boss.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.240
No way.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.400
This gorgeous lady
is my personal bodyguard.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.120
Her name is Rawee.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.680
Bodyguard?

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.520
Oh, I don't mind!

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.320
Once she debuts and becomes famous,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.440
I'll give you a share
of the profits, no problem.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.720
Please? She's stunning.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.280
Sorry, but…

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.680
I'm kind of possessive over this one.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.200
Well, understandable.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.680
She really is stunning.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.880
I just finished recording a new rap verse.
Wanna come listen?

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960
Let's go.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.640
- I really put my heart into it.
- Okay, fine.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.080
Oh, and I still need to talk about
that bloody doll.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.920
What happened with that, anyway?

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.440
What is it, Chanya?

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.680
Chanya!

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.000
Yes, boss.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.760
<i>I've got a report.</i>

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.080
We got info on the bloody cloth doll.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.160
There were fingerprints inside the box,

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.840
and Nana's checking them now.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.040
<i>As for the blood,</i>

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.840
it's not human.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.800
It's animal blood. Nothing dangerous.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.720
If you get any more details,
just send them to my email.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.200
Got it. Oh, boss.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.000
How's work…

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.680
going?

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.320
Nothing much.
Just haven't signed off on the bonus yet.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.280
What? The bonus?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.360
Boss, I didn't want to ask, really.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.400
Typhoon and Nana made me do it!

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.120
I would never…

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.240
Chanya, stop!

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.880
Stop talking. Quiet!

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.840
- I didn't say anything, boss!
- Hey!

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.560
I'm hanging up.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.360
- Hello! Hi!
- So pretty! Are you tired?

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.360
Not tired at all. Are you guys tired?

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.280
We're fine!

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.600
Thanks so much for coming today!

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.720
- Make sure you rest up!
- You too!

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800
Bye-bye!

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.720
Bye…

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.120
Jam, can we head
to the Sathorn house today?

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.880
Yes, ma'am.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.480
The Sathorn house?

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.240
Yeah, I have two houses.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.600
That one's for when I work late.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.840
It's more convenient.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.920
You live there alone?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.720
Yup, all by myself.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.480
But don't worry.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.560
It's been through every safety check
approved by Mr. Thana.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.160
Dad handpicked it himself.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.280
Rejected at least ten
before settling on this one.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.440
Back then, I took him to so many places.
He didn't like a single one.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.880
"This one's too big."
"That one's too small."

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.640
"That one had a tiny kitchen.
What if Ayla tripped?"

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.920
When we finally got this place,
it was like fireworks went off.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.800
He really cares about you.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.000
Yeah. It's just me and my dad, you know?

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.520
He's super protective.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.280
Can I get out now?

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.280
Please.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.640
Come on in.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.800
Oops.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.440
I'm starving.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.080
Want to make something simple to eat?

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.920
You know how to cook?

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.000
If I said yes, would you believe me?

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.760
Based on the file I read,

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.520
you don't know how to cook.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.719
The file is pretty accurate.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.240
There's literally nothing to eat.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.840
Usually, I just order delivery.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.320
It's easy.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.200
I'll make egg fried rice.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.080
Think you can handle that?

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.000
Done.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.640
That looks so good!

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.280
Wanna eat now?

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.640
Careful. It's hot.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.120
I didn't know

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.160
egg fried rice with chili sauce
could taste this good.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.640
Where did you learn this?
It's just a few ingredients, right?

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.160
It's my survival recipe.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.440
But I don't think it's that good.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.720
No, it is.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.240
I could eat the whole pan.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.360
Then go ahead. Eat lots.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.680
Thank you

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.680
for making this for me.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.800
You'll cook for me again sometime, right?

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.800
I should head out now.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.960
I'll pick you up here tomorrow
at 8 a.m., okay?

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.720
Got it.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.560
See you then.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.000
Thank you.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.240
And if anything seems off,
call me anytime.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.040
Will do.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.800
Is there an emergency?

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.680
Whoa, you picked up so fast.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.520
I don't think it even rang once.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.960
So, no emergency?

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.520
There is. That's why
I'm calling to report it.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.600
What is it?

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.800
I can't sleep. What should I do?

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.640
Can't sleep?

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.160
Can't sleep…

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.680
And what would you like me
to do about that?

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.360
<i>Can you</i>

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.640
talk to me for a bit?

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.560
Maybe if we keep talking,
I'll start to feel sleepy.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.480
Sure.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.400
What do you want to talk about?

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.440
Then…

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.360
Can I tell you about myself?

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.120
If it's about you,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.160
I already know everything.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.040
Tawan!

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.240
Go ahead.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.960
Even if I've heard it all,
I don't mind listening again.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.160
You know, back then,
I was so nervous about the audition.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.120
That year, the competition was insane.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.520
<i>The day before the final round,</i>
<i>I still remember,</i>

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.320
<i>I had muscle inflammation.</i>
<i>Dad didn't want me to compete.</i>

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.760
<i>I had to beg him in tears,</i>
<i>practically crying blood.</i>

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.600
<i>Almost chased my dream</i>
<i>and lost my home all in one go.</i>

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.000
<i>When I was a trainee,</i>
<i>I trained like crazy.</i>

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.160
<i>At least</i>

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.720
<i>eight hours a day, singing, dancing.</i>

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.440
<i>And that's not even counting acting.</i>

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.840
And all the extra practice I had to do
on my own because I wasn't good enough.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.800
It was brutal.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.960
<i>I only got a few hours of sleep a day.</i>

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.400
<i>And that's not even the whole story!</i>
<i>I've got a lot more to tell.</i>

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.320
The journey of a people's idol!

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.640
Tawan!

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.960
What happened?

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.400
Power outage. Don't hang up, okay?

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.560
<i>The lights just went out.</i>

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.440
Tawan, the lights are back.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.880
By the way,
I want to go to an amusement park.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.080
Ever since I told you I wanted to go,

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.000
I haven't gone yet. Can you believe that?

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.720
- Tawan!
- <i>Yes?</i>

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.000
I'm almost at the front door.
I don't see anyone outside though.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.760
<i>Ayla, listen to me. Be careful.</i>

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.360
Okay.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.280
<i>Approach slowly.</i>

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.680
<i>If you see anything, scream.</i>

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.320
I'm at the door now.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.400
<i>Stay alert.</i>

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.760
<i>Move slowly.</i>

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.280
Tawan!

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.520
Morning. I brought congee.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.920
How did you know

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.000
I love congee with Chinese crullers?

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.040
I told you, I have all your info.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.520
No way. That's not in the files.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.320
There's this girl who chattered non-stop
about what she liked to eat

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.160
around 4 a.m.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.520
This place sells good congee,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.160
so I bought it and came straight here.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.720
You know what?
I think we both need caffeine now.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.000
This time, it's on me,
since you bought me breakfast. Deal?

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.280
Ayla!

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.800
Tawan works like this.
won't her lover get mad?

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.040
This goes against protocol, you know.
Is this really okay?

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.720
Something smells fishy.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.320
<i>Right now, your safety is my duty</i>

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.160
<i>and my responsibility.</i>

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.720
But if you're not happy
with the way I'm doing things,

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.640
I'm willing to step down.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.400
