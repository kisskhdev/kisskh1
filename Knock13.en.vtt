This series is a work of fiction. It is not related
to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.782
Thun.

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:07.142
Wake up, there's some
congee for you to eat.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.934
Yeah.

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.365
Thun, wake up.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.380
Wake up.

00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:26.388
Hey, what's wrong? Didn't
you get any sleep last night?

00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:28.412
It's because of you.

00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:05.401
Again?

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.662
It's cold.

00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:07.911
If you're cold, just put on a sweater.

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:10.955
I did, but it made me hot.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.910
We've lived together so long and you're still
using the same trick to steal the remote?

00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:39.724
Then how about this trick instead?

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:41.748
Ouch!

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.094
How do I change this?

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:52.521
Fine. You wanna play it that way?

00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:02.817
Thun, give me the remote.
You little troublemaker.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:05.305
Thun!

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:08.655
Alright.

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:10.102
Try this move!

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.483
Ow!

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.001
How's that?

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:19.846
Come here!

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.614
Ouch!

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:23.141
One…

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.522
Two… Thun!

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:26.450
Three!

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:35.225
That really hurt, Thun.

00:03:40.047 --> 00:03:42.884
What are you staring at?

00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:46.141
Hey! Hand it over!

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:50.368
Keen!

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:21.693
It's because of last night,

00:04:21.717 --> 00:04:23.879
that's why I didn't get any sleep.

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.567
Anyway.

00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:31.526
I made shrimp congee for you.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.224
Hot and fresh.

00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:38.431
Does it smell good?

00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:49.293
Hey!

00:04:50.027 --> 00:04:54.658
Thun, I told you not to add
chili powder to the porridge!

00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:56.659
You'll get an upset stomach again.

00:04:56.683 --> 00:04:58.683
You never listen.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.781
It tastes bland without it.

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:10.315
If you want to add it, then don't eat.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.083
If you're going to eat, hand
me the chili powder bottle.

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.475
Give it here, Thun!

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:30.222
Give me the bottle, you're not eating it.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.062
Thun.

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:31.748
No.

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:32.670
Give it to me.

00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:34.258
No.

00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:37.826
Give it to me.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:38.715
I want to eat it.

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:39.591
You can't.

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:40.618
But I want to.

00:05:40.642 --> 00:05:42.306
Give it or your stomach's
going to get messed up again.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.853
No.

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:46.585
Give it here, Thun.

00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:48.609
Come and get it, then.

00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:51.854
It's up here.

00:05:55.508 --> 00:05:57.508
Come get it.

00:06:29.707 --> 00:06:31.707
Hey!

00:06:32.342 --> 00:06:33.751
That's that.

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:35.992
Now go finish your food.

00:06:36.677 --> 00:06:38.677
Go eat.

00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:47.741
You never listen.

00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:02.212
Thun.

00:07:27.508 --> 00:07:30.563
Yes, we have a private course if you want.

00:07:30.587 --> 00:07:33.937
Thun Tiger Taming Canon
will be your instructor.

00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:35.961
One, two, one, two.

00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:47.744
Like this, right?

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.841
Ouch!

00:07:56.927 --> 00:08:00.897
Jay, come on, let's keep going!

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:04.059
Alright, in one set now.
One, two, three, four!

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:07.342
Sure, I can get it for you.

00:08:07.366 --> 00:08:09.366
See you next week.

00:08:10.132 --> 00:08:12.132
One, two.

00:08:21.007 --> 00:08:21.753
Oh!

00:08:21.777 --> 00:08:24.951
Hey Keen, I've got something
I need your help with.

00:08:24.975 --> 00:08:27.642
Nice, let's do one more round.

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.484
Kaew!

00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:32.349
Hello, Keen.

00:08:32.373 --> 00:08:33.351
Hi.

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:37.416
Kaew wants to ask you
to help tutor her in English.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.114
Ait said you're really good at English.

00:08:41.138 --> 00:08:45.107
So I'd really like you to tutor me a little.

00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:54.364
Alright, sure.

00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:59.266
Stay with Keen and behave, okay?

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.840
I know! I'm not a little kid anymore.

00:09:01.864 --> 00:09:03.397
Okay, then.

00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.962
I'll get going, look after Kaew for me.

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:08.285
See you. Bye-bye.

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:09.880
Bye!

00:09:29.767 --> 00:09:32.259
So, what do you want me to teach you, Kaew?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.780
Kaew.

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:41.487
What do you want to learn?

00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:43.757
Oh.

00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:03.230
I want to learn this.

00:10:03.254 --> 00:10:04.372
This.

00:10:13.394 --> 00:10:14.976
Keen?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.833
Yes?

00:10:15.857 --> 00:10:19.486
Can we study out by the training area?

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:25.634
I want to sit somewhere open and comfy.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.295
Is that okay?

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:32.086
Outside?

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.008
Yes, please.

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:39.609
Move your right foot more to the right.

00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:41.412
Kick with your right leg.

00:10:41.436 --> 00:10:42.576
Twist into it.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.723
Right kick!

00:10:43.747 --> 00:10:45.206
Right kick!

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.676
Left!

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:52.925
Alright, Kaew. Today I'm going
to teach you about W-questions.

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:55.314
It's not hard, there are eight of them.

00:10:55.338 --> 00:11:01.196
There's what, when, where,
why, how, and then whose, whom.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.196
Like what means?

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.967
For example, if I ask,
What are you looking at?

00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:10.080
I'm looking at the most gorgeous
and handsome person of all time.

00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:13.702
The combination of strength and beauty.

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:19.964
Wait, are you talking about Thun?

00:11:19.988 --> 00:11:21.988
No! Eww!

00:11:23.189 --> 00:11:24.771
Thun is your boyfriend.

00:11:24.795 --> 00:11:26.047
I need it.

00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:28.523
He...

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:32.727
He what?

00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:34.593
Friend. He's my friend.

00:11:34.617 --> 00:11:35.701
Friend?

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.310
Okay, that's enough for today.

00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:55.609
Oh, hey Kaew.

00:11:56.984 --> 00:11:58.566
What are you doing here?

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.128
Oh, I came to ask Keen
to help tutor me in English.

00:12:06.181 --> 00:12:09.568
Really? Even the top
student needs extra tutoring?

00:12:09.592 --> 00:12:11.223
Huh?

00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:13.483
Oh!

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.095
Uh... Jay, Phong's been waiting a while.

00:12:25.888 --> 00:12:27.888
Yes, Coach.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.106
Hello.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.010
I'll go now, see you at school.

00:12:40.497 --> 00:12:41.882
You like Jay, don't you?

00:12:41.906 --> 00:12:43.739
How did you know?

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.065
Wow, it's so obvious.

00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:48.091
Anyone could tell.

00:12:48.115 --> 00:12:49.273
Exactly.

00:12:49.955 --> 00:12:52.250
Pretending to ask for English lessons

00:12:52.274 --> 00:12:54.944
just so you could peek at Jay, huh?

00:12:54.968 --> 00:12:56.156
You're sneaky.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.077
Even from over there,

00:12:58.101 --> 00:13:00.001
I could tell.

00:13:01.466 --> 00:13:04.471
Can you promise

00:13:04.495 --> 00:13:06.471
not to tell anyone?

00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:08.780
Even Ait and Mawin don't know yet.

00:13:08.804 --> 00:13:10.425
Promise?

00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:13.616
Ah, fine.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.499
We promise, our lips are sealed.

00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:23.414
In that case… can you two
help me win Jay's heart?

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:25.736
No need to rush, Kaew.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.553
Take your time, get to know him.

00:13:27.577 --> 00:13:30.350
You're in such a hurry.

00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:31.773
Well,

00:13:31.797 --> 00:13:35.486
You're saying that because
you don't know how to flirt.

00:13:37.808 --> 00:13:41.876
Come on, Kaew. I'll help you.

00:13:43.436 --> 00:13:45.215
Don't listen to him,

00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:46.878
he's full of it.

00:13:46.902 --> 00:13:50.374
But if you listen to me, you'll
have Jay falling for you in no time.

00:13:50.398 --> 00:13:51.514
For real.

00:13:54.984 --> 00:13:56.984
I'll be watching.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.040
Kaew!

00:14:27.514 --> 00:14:31.160
What's that in your hand? A love letter?

00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:32.618
Yes!

00:14:32.642 --> 00:14:36.425
Whoa, super classic.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.523
From my experience, if you
like someone, just go for it.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.764
Don't hesitate, got it?

00:14:43.788 --> 00:14:45.788
Okay!

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.548
Should I go for it now?

00:14:48.572 --> 00:14:49.686
Hmm?

00:14:51.055 --> 00:14:52.440
Can you even drive?

00:14:52.464 --> 00:14:55.372
If not, I guess I'll have to learn right now.

00:14:56.022 --> 00:14:58.022
Kaew!

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.289
Ouch!

00:15:00.313 --> 00:15:02.242
Kaew! Jay!

00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:04.005
Jay!

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.507
Ouch!

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.217
Get up first. Are you okay?

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.467
Are you hurt?

00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:14.798
When I said go for it, I didn't
mean literally launch yourself!

00:15:14.822 --> 00:15:16.822
Maybe I went a little too hard.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Alright, get up.

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.690
Let's go inside.

00:15:20.714 --> 00:15:21.954
Ouch...

00:15:21.978 --> 00:15:23.715
It's not too bad, right?

00:15:30.001 --> 00:15:33.323
Listen. Put the pen here means.

00:15:33.347 --> 00:15:36.451
Place the pen here.

00:15:36.475 --> 00:15:39.825
Take out your book
means, take your book out.

00:15:39.849 --> 00:15:43.565
Repeat after me means, say what I say.

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:46.988
Point to the picture
means, point at the picture.

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:50.608
Clear the blackboard
means, erase the board.

00:15:50.632 --> 00:15:55.021
Draw a cat means, draw a cat.
Very good!

00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:59.351
Colour the dog brown
means, color the dog brown.

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:03.999
Go back to your seat
means, return to your seat.

00:16:04.023 --> 00:16:05.495
I'm going home now.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.008
Oh, okay. Take care.

00:16:08.032 --> 00:16:11.488
Bye. Bye-bye!

00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:29.541
Okay, let's start over.

00:16:30.325 --> 00:16:33.408
Forget everything Keen said.

00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:43.592
If you like someone and
want them to like you back,

00:16:43.616 --> 00:16:46.256
you have to be ready to protect them.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.972
Aah! Help!

00:16:51.996 --> 00:16:54.932
Help! Get out!

00:16:56.404 --> 00:16:57.543
Aah!

00:16:57.567 --> 00:16:59.087
Stop!

00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:01.457
Ouch!

00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:05.979
Wait, Kaew!

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.594
What are you doing?!

00:17:09.618 --> 00:17:11.590
I'm protecting Jay myself!

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:14.536
That's my driver...

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.557
Driver?

00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:17.636
Sorry about that.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.334
It's alright.

00:17:19.827 --> 00:17:24.585
This is Phong, Jay's driver.

00:17:25.353 --> 00:17:27.767
He picks Jay up every day.

00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:30.333
Haven't you seen him before?

00:17:33.107 --> 00:17:35.083
Sorry about that.

00:17:35.107 --> 00:17:37.097
It's okay.

00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:40.401
So what happened?

00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:46.497
It's nothing, it's just.

00:17:54.193 --> 00:17:55.677
I'm really sorry.

00:17:55.701 --> 00:17:56.999
No worries.

00:17:57.023 --> 00:17:59.814
Mr.Jay, time to head home.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:10.295
Ugh! I should've just asked Ait and Mawin
for help, they're lovey-dovey every day.

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:13.218
Please! We're the same!

00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:16.062
No one's lovey-dovey every day.

00:18:16.086 --> 00:18:19.387
If you don't believe me,
go check it out yourself.

00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:21.190
But you have to sneak.

00:18:21.214 --> 00:18:25.616
Ait and Mawin never act
sweet when others are around.

00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:29.645
(Petchsak Boxing Gym)

00:18:30.236 --> 00:18:31.966
Hmm.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.094
Place your hand here.

00:18:33.118 --> 00:18:34.917
Uh-huh.

00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:35.705
Like that.

00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:36.935
Exactly.

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:37.623
Right.

00:18:37.647 --> 00:18:38.362
Yep.

00:18:38.386 --> 00:18:40.109
Now try flicking it.

00:18:42.152 --> 00:18:42.750
Like that?

00:18:42.774 --> 00:18:44.665
Hmm, it looks good.

00:18:44.689 --> 00:18:46.192
Do it again.

00:18:46.216 --> 00:18:47.136
But gently this time.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.494
Whoa, you're pretty good, bro.

00:18:50.518 --> 00:18:52.641
Right? Natural talent.

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:56.415
You're so good, I've got a reward for you.

00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:58.925
What? What is it?

00:19:31.122 --> 00:19:33.122
Who's there?

00:19:35.826 --> 00:19:37.900
Ait, I'm sorry.

00:19:37.924 --> 00:19:40.613
You okay?

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.236
Does it hurt?

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:47.478
Wow, I never see you two flirt.

00:19:49.702 --> 00:19:51.235
Why?

00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:54.790
You guys never flirt or what?

00:20:03.877 --> 00:20:06.144
I'm gonna go hang the laundry.

00:20:06.168 --> 00:20:08.245
It's probably all musty now.

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:10.269
Let's go.

00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:16.018
Hey.

00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:18.980
The washing machine's behind the gym!

00:20:24.395 --> 00:20:27.006
See? I told you so!

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.119
Who said we never flirt?

00:20:29.143 --> 00:20:31.119
We did, right, Thun?

00:20:31.143 --> 00:20:33.546
Hmm…

00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:38.329
You flirted with me first.

00:20:38.353 --> 00:20:42.097
What? Says who?

00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:43.752
You flirted first!

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:47.185
Oh yeah? When did that happen?

00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:49.209
At the temple!

00:20:50.128 --> 00:20:51.488
Temple?

00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:53.387
Aah!

00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:59.286
You stepped in to help me from some thugs because
at that moment, I was just so charming and fragile.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.602
So you risked yourself to protect me.

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:04.368
Nope, not true.

00:21:04.392 --> 00:21:07.937
Coach Petch told Thun to go get you.

00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:12.785
I saw someone in
danger, of course I'd help.

00:21:14.737 --> 00:21:16.737
Or maybe…

00:21:19.096 --> 00:21:21.658
You fell in love with me at that moment?

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:23.239
What?! No way!

00:21:23.948 --> 00:21:28.706
Who falls in love over
something like that?!

00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:37.541
And when did I supposedly

00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:39.565
flirt with you first?

00:21:41.577 --> 00:21:43.874
At the bathroom.

00:21:43.898 --> 00:21:45.898
When you asked me,

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.515
Can you help me shower?

00:22:00.001 --> 00:22:04.606
That wasn't flirting! I just wanted
you to get back into the ring!

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.122
Mhm, sure.

00:22:12.317 --> 00:22:18.903
If we were really flirting, we'd have
met at a bar, chatted each other up...

00:22:18.927 --> 00:22:20.927
Not done this.

00:22:22.006 --> 00:22:27.256
But we've never done that kind of thing.

00:22:28.813 --> 00:22:33.402
Ugh, can I say something?

00:22:33.426 --> 00:22:38.381
If you've never actually flirted
before, then just try it. It'd be adorable.

00:22:39.703 --> 00:22:43.279
Anyway, I've got to work on my report now!

00:23:33.754 --> 00:23:35.754
Ugh...

00:23:45.001 --> 00:23:50.485
What she said might actually work.

00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:52.952
Should we try flirting with each other?

00:23:55.016 --> 00:23:58.399
Why bother? We're already a couple.

00:23:58.423 --> 00:24:00.399
Scared?

00:24:00.423 --> 00:24:01.699
Who's scared?

00:24:03.491 --> 00:24:05.491
Then let's make it a challenge:

00:24:06.274 --> 00:24:10.253
Whoever's heart races first, loses.

00:24:10.277 --> 00:24:16.090
Let's play rock-paper-scissors,
winner starts.

00:24:16.114 --> 00:24:18.114
Okay.

00:24:23.223 --> 00:24:26.011
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.000
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:24:32.363 --> 00:24:34.339
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:24:34.363 --> 00:24:38.376
Ugh, what is this?

00:24:41.509 --> 00:24:45.474
Okay, let's do a staring contest.

00:24:45.498 --> 00:24:47.498
Winner gets to start.

00:24:52.595 --> 00:24:54.595
Ready? Go.

00:25:25.609 --> 00:25:27.609
Yes!

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.636
I won!

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.985
I'll start first.

00:25:35.443 --> 00:25:38.526
Whoever's heart races first loses!

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:43.404
(Operation: Perfect Flirt Plan)

00:25:43.428 --> 00:25:46.452
Bro, why did you bring me here?

00:25:46.476 --> 00:25:47.829
How would I know?!

00:25:47.853 --> 00:25:51.011
I was dragged along too.

00:25:52.845 --> 00:25:58.194
Thanks, everyone, for attending the presentation
of my Perfect Plan to Flirt with Thun.

00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:01.297
Let's not waste time.

00:26:01.321 --> 00:26:09.321
I'm going to explain how my plan is
guaranteed to make Thun's heart race.

00:26:10.795 --> 00:26:14.047
It's the ultimate sensual massage
plan, candlelit and steamy.

00:26:14.071 --> 00:26:19.321
I'll transform our bedroom
into a romantic spa.

00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:42.267
Wait, that's too basic. You
need something more surprising.

00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:43.331
Surprising?

00:26:43.355 --> 00:26:44.355
Mhm.

00:26:59.666 --> 00:27:01.961
Why are you blindfolding me, Keen?

00:27:03.237 --> 00:27:05.729
Because it's a surprise.

00:27:10.006 --> 00:27:12.006
Surprise!

00:27:26.998 --> 00:27:30.000
Alright, please take off your clothes, sir.

00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:33.458
Do I really need to?

00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:08.433
Lie down on the bed.

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:13.490
Slowly now and down the other way.

00:28:13.514 --> 00:28:14.702
Turn the other way?

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:15.755
Yeah.

00:28:32.956 --> 00:28:36.680
How much oil should I use?

00:28:37.637 --> 00:28:41.016
Not too much, it gets sticky.

00:28:41.848 --> 00:28:42.642
Just a bit.

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:43.666
Sure.

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.089
Ok.

00:28:46.626 --> 00:28:47.838
Hey.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.301
Whoa, isn't that too much?

00:28:50.325 --> 00:28:51.352
Smells good, right?

00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:59.046
It helps relax the body and
rebalance your energy and spirit.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.061
Just a little more…

00:29:01.804 --> 00:29:02.549
That's enough!

00:29:02.573 --> 00:29:03.530
Okay!

00:29:03.554 --> 00:29:05.180
If you're gonna give a massage,

00:29:05.204 --> 00:29:07.142
you have to really go all in, Keen.

00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:09.703
Like, step on me if you have to.

00:29:09.727 --> 00:29:12.232
Go all the way.

00:29:13.933 --> 00:29:15.761
Wow, you weren't into it just now.

00:29:15.785 --> 00:29:18.364
But suddenly you're all enthusiastic?

00:29:21.068 --> 00:29:23.068
Step harder!

00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:26.025
Ow!

00:29:26.049 --> 00:29:27.940
Like this? Is that pressure okay?

00:29:27.964 --> 00:29:29.592
Yeah, this is good, right?

00:29:29.616 --> 00:29:31.337
Right, it's okay? Okay!

00:29:31.361 --> 00:29:34.101
It's ok?

00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:35.798
If it's too much, just let me know.

00:29:35.822 --> 00:29:36.981
Not too much at all.

00:29:37.005 --> 00:29:38.630
Ow.

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:39.977
Right there!

00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:41.031
Hold on a sec.

00:29:41.055 --> 00:29:42.360
Yeah, right there.

00:29:46.882 --> 00:29:49.064
Hey, hey.

00:29:49.088 --> 00:29:50.227
Shit!

00:29:50.251 --> 00:29:51.626
What's going on, Keen?

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.929
Nothing, Thun. Just lie
down, I'll keep massaging.

00:29:58.273 --> 00:29:59.976
You sure?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.438
Yeah, I've got it under control.

00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:08.710
Hey.

00:30:27.918 --> 00:30:30.633
Gently lift it.

00:30:30.657 --> 00:30:32.402
Just a sec.

00:30:32.426 --> 00:30:33.005
Go.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.410
Come on.

00:30:41.658 --> 00:30:43.388
All done.

00:30:43.412 --> 00:30:44.977
So? Looks good, right?

00:30:45.001 --> 00:30:46.510
Looks awesome.

00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:51.069
Thun, you just brought me
here to watch a ghost movie?

00:30:51.093 --> 00:30:54.570
Your plan to flirt with Keen
is a bit basic, don't you think?

00:30:56.983 --> 00:30:59.623
This is just the appetizer, Mai.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:02.421
Let me tell you.

00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:06.278
Hey, hey, not yet!

00:31:06.302 --> 00:31:07.728
I don't wanna get spoiled.

00:31:07.752 --> 00:31:11.073
I mean, what if you're
not ok with something?

00:31:13.659 --> 00:31:16.398
I trust you guys.

00:31:17.181 --> 00:31:21.200
Whatever you want to do, go all out.

00:31:25.097 --> 00:31:26.137
Well said!

00:31:26.161 --> 00:31:34.161
All I want is for Keen to be
surprised and fall into my arms.

00:31:34.497 --> 00:31:35.170
Wow.

00:31:35.194 --> 00:31:36.749
Then I'll win.

00:31:36.773 --> 00:31:40.485
You can totally count on us.

00:31:44.192 --> 00:31:48.556
Man, you guys are so cringe.

00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:52.651
You talk too much.

00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:55.908
Get over here. Whoa, Mai!

00:31:55.932 --> 00:31:57.120
Come on, group power!

00:31:57.144 --> 00:32:00.838
One, two! Yay!

00:32:03.344 --> 00:32:06.525
Step up, great job!

00:32:07.684 --> 00:32:09.410
What are you doing?

00:32:09.434 --> 00:32:10.434
Wait a sec!

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.598
This is such a weird game.

00:32:19.222 --> 00:32:21.198
Go straight.

00:32:21.222 --> 00:32:22.868
Are we gonna hit the edge?

00:32:22.892 --> 00:32:23.839
Nope, we're good.

00:32:23.863 --> 00:32:25.298
I'm watching, don't worry.

00:32:35.225 --> 00:32:38.013
Well? Do you like it?

00:32:40.476 --> 00:32:42.550
What is this?

00:32:42.574 --> 00:32:44.414
We're watching a movie?
We're watching a movie?

00:32:45.738 --> 00:32:47.130
Yeah.

00:32:47.154 --> 00:32:49.154
You'll see.

00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:16.029
Want some?

00:34:17.243 --> 00:34:19.220
Thun, the door's creaky.

00:34:19.244 --> 00:34:22.524
Put some oil on it, it's too loud.

00:34:26.804 --> 00:34:32.596
(Not working! On to the next plan!!)

00:34:40.753 --> 00:34:47.099
Help... Help...

00:35:22.588 --> 00:35:25.401
Thun, there's still so
much dust in the air.

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:28.209
Let's go buy an air purifier tomorrow.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.720
Yeah.

00:36:00.032 --> 00:36:02.008
Hey!

00:36:02.032 --> 00:36:02.827
Oww!

00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:04.636
Ow, P'Thun, stop! Hey!

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.733
Thun, don't hurt me, please!
Whoa! Stop!

00:36:07.757 --> 00:36:10.212
Stop, stop!

00:36:10.236 --> 00:36:12.212
This isn't what we agreed on!

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:13.794
You said no punching!

00:36:13.818 --> 00:36:16.599
What the hell are you doing?!
You scared the crap out of me!

00:36:16.623 --> 00:36:17.735
Ugh…

00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:18.441
You okay?

00:36:18.465 --> 00:36:20.633
I'm not okay!

00:36:23.366 --> 00:36:26.027
Didn't you say you trusted us?

00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:28.915
You said do whatever it takes to
make Keen's heart race and hug you.

00:36:28.939 --> 00:36:31.525
We went all out!

00:36:31.549 --> 00:36:33.033
Look!

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.923
Argh!

00:36:40.548 --> 00:36:45.000
Bro, ghost face!

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:49.112
You're kind of cute when you're scared.

00:36:49.136 --> 00:36:51.136
My heart almost skipped.

00:36:55.236 --> 00:36:58.221
I'm in so much pain, bro.

00:37:06.515 --> 00:37:08.121
It hurts like hell.

00:37:17.354 --> 00:37:18.812
What's wrong?

00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:21.326
Mawin.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.187
Do you think Thun and Keen will last?

00:37:25.266 --> 00:37:27.577
They won't break up
over something like this.

00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:29.577
Yeah, seriously.

00:37:29.601 --> 00:37:34.204
I've seen them argue all the time.

00:37:34.228 --> 00:37:37.256
But I think they love each
other more than you guys.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.895
Hey, that's not true.

00:37:42.536 --> 00:37:44.536
If you don't believe me.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.280
Hey.

00:37:48.304 --> 00:37:50.294
Whoa, what the heck?

00:37:50.318 --> 00:37:52.387
Are you embarrassed in front of Mai?

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.151
I'm Jealous of Thun and Keen.

00:38:03.175 --> 00:38:06.061
Every time I see them,
they're always all lovey-dovey.

00:38:19.001 --> 00:38:21.001
Are you really mad at me?

00:38:29.085 --> 00:38:32.956
What do I have to do to make it up to you?

00:38:36.643 --> 00:38:41.647
Then kiss me on the cheek in
front of Mai and I'll forgive you.

00:38:43.963 --> 00:38:48.040
Kiss! Kiss!

00:38:48.064 --> 00:38:49.843
Do it, do it! Hurry!

00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:57.867
Kiss! Kiss!

00:39:08.423 --> 00:39:09.901
I'm kidding.

00:39:09.925 --> 00:39:11.703
Whoa.

00:39:11.727 --> 00:39:15.000
As if I could stay mad at you.

00:39:36.766 --> 00:39:38.766
Looks like both our plans failed, huh?

00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:48.395
Who says? I still have a secret weapon.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.642
Don't get too cocky.

00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:56.107
Your secret weapon doesn't beat mine.

00:40:13.683 --> 00:40:15.683
Wow.

00:40:16.171 --> 00:40:20.781
Funny, when it comes to
this stuff, we always agree.

00:40:21.684 --> 00:40:25.260
Because it's our special memory.

00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:27.681
Yeah.

00:40:28.907 --> 00:40:31.744
We've come a long way, haven't we?

00:40:36.465 --> 00:40:39.105
Here, let me light it.

00:41:02.311 --> 00:41:04.311
I'll try another one.

00:41:17.928 --> 00:41:20.812
Thun.

00:41:20.836 --> 00:41:23.230
It won't light. It's damp.

00:41:25.431 --> 00:41:27.776
Here, let me try.

00:41:44.782 --> 00:41:46.782
Stop, Keen.

00:41:58.719 --> 00:42:06.719
Why are we always like this?

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.160
Why do we always try to outdo each other?

00:42:18.664 --> 00:42:20.664
Exactly.

00:42:22.647 --> 00:42:25.583
I don't think we can keep going like this.

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:33.035
Should we just go back to being strangers?

00:42:43.108 --> 00:42:45.108
Keen.

00:42:46.285 --> 00:42:48.285
Keen!

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:30.238
Two whiskeys on the rocks, please.
Sure.

00:43:43.317 --> 00:43:46.943
Can I buy you a drink?

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.286
Why are you buying a drink for a stranger?

00:44:00.001 --> 00:44:08.001
I just want to get to
know you. Is that okay?

00:44:13.395 --> 00:44:15.395
Sure.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.138
But what about you?

00:44:44.499 --> 00:44:50.882
Someone as handsome as you must be taken.

00:44:53.744 --> 00:44:55.744
Nope.

00:44:59.049 --> 00:45:07.049
But maybe that person could
be you, if you'll let me court you.

00:45:11.519 --> 00:45:13.519
Okay.

00:45:14.351 --> 00:45:17.484
If you can beat me first.

00:45:29.714 --> 00:45:31.714
Whoa.

00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:37.401
Then do I even have a chance?

00:45:37.425 --> 00:45:41.740
I'll give you head start,
just hit the target once.

00:46:22.552 --> 00:46:28.522
The more stressed you are,
the harder it is to hit the mark.

00:46:28.546 --> 00:46:31.038
You need to relax a bit.

00:46:37.689 --> 00:46:45.574
Maybe I'm missing on purpose
so I can stay close to you.

00:46:45.598 --> 00:46:46.075
Ow!

00:46:46.099 --> 00:46:47.884
Hey, don't block the way.

00:46:47.908 --> 00:46:49.071
Hey.

00:46:50.238 --> 00:46:51.771
Sorry.

00:46:51.795 --> 00:46:53.169
Yeah!

00:46:58.499 --> 00:47:00.475
It's ok.

00:47:00.499 --> 00:47:02.715
It's fine.

00:47:16.055 --> 00:47:19.013
I win.

00:47:19.037 --> 00:47:24.386
So that means I get to court you now?

00:47:26.501 --> 00:47:34.501
You kind of remind me of my ex.

00:47:35.673 --> 00:47:38.264
He always had to win.

00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:43.171
Really?

00:47:44.657 --> 00:47:51.008
And you're not that
different from my ex either.

00:47:51.032 --> 00:47:53.699
He always had to be in control.

00:47:53.723 --> 00:47:56.133
Always competing.

00:47:56.157 --> 00:47:59.365
And...

00:47:59.389 --> 00:48:04.670
Always doing everything to come out on top.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:09.605
Honestly, he acted like a child.

00:48:09.629 --> 00:48:11.063
Hey!

00:48:11.087 --> 00:48:13.000
Ow! That hurts!

00:48:13.024 --> 00:48:13.924
Let go!

00:48:13.948 --> 00:48:16.451
Why? I can't grab you back? Why?

00:48:16.475 --> 00:48:18.033
You expect me to just give in all the time?

00:48:18.057 --> 00:48:20.187
You think the world revolves around you?

00:48:20.211 --> 00:48:22.922
Keep acting like this and
we should just break up.

00:48:22.946 --> 00:48:23.885
I'm not breaking up.

00:48:23.909 --> 00:48:25.062
Why not?

00:48:25.086 --> 00:48:26.134
Why?

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.076
You don't have the right
to hurt people like this.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.195
Ow!

00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:34.992
What are you gonna do, huh?

00:48:35.016 --> 00:48:38.614
Stay out of it, this is
between husband and wife!

00:48:38.638 --> 00:48:42.284
Husband and wife? We broke up ages ago.

00:48:42.308 --> 00:48:44.136
Move.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.242
I said move.

00:48:52.277 --> 00:48:54.277
You're dead, man. Whoa!

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.903
Thun... Tiger Taming Canon.

00:49:03.927 --> 00:49:04.870
I'm taming you, punk.

00:49:04.894 --> 00:49:06.967
Sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:49:06.991 --> 00:49:09.025
Sorry!

00:49:31.983 --> 00:49:33.983
Shit.

00:49:35.468 --> 00:49:40.345
Hey!

00:49:40.369 --> 00:49:42.369
Shit!

00:50:20.245 --> 00:50:27.219
At first, it seemed fine…
but it ended in chaos again.

00:50:30.545 --> 00:50:36.140
Who says? I've still got one last move.

00:50:44.088 --> 00:50:46.088
Here.

00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:51.069
Let me light it for you.

00:51:22.982 --> 00:51:24.982
So pretty.

00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:36.880
What's that?

00:51:36.904 --> 00:51:37.623
A heart.

00:51:37.647 --> 00:51:39.460
Correct.

00:51:47.487 --> 00:51:49.315
A star.

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:51.058
That's right too.

00:52:01.502 --> 00:52:03.502
Thun.

00:52:04.291 --> 00:52:07.986
Do you think one day we'll be like that?

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:11.635
Like… end up breaking up because
we can't find middle ground?

00:52:13.306 --> 00:52:15.897
Why are you thinking that?

00:52:18.196 --> 00:52:23.781
Because we're still the same.

00:52:23.805 --> 00:52:30.000
Still arguing. Nothing's changed.

00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:35.771
True.

00:52:37.218 --> 00:52:45.218
You're stubborn, bossy, always has to win.

00:53:06.869 --> 00:53:14.869
But you know why I love you?
Because you're exactly like that.

00:53:30.001 --> 00:53:32.001
Same goes for me.

00:53:34.102 --> 00:53:42.102
Overly sensitive, quietly
stubborn, and always trying to win.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.733
We're still the same, aren't we?

00:53:50.757 --> 00:53:56.598
Arguing about the same
things, nothing's changed.

00:53:58.203 --> 00:54:00.203
Can you accept that, Keen?

00:54:13.585 --> 00:54:20.559
But in the end, we always
come back to loving each other.

00:54:21.794 --> 00:54:23.794
Yeah.

00:54:27.702 --> 00:54:33.740
Let's keep loving each other
like this for a long, long time.

00:55:07.249 --> 00:55:08.904
(Petchsak Academy)

00:55:15.987 --> 00:55:18.648
All of us came in a big
group to eat like this…

00:55:18.672 --> 00:55:21.805
When Uncle Petch gets back from
the temple, he's going to complain again.

00:55:22.692 --> 00:55:24.323
Wow, Keen.

00:55:24.347 --> 00:55:27.166
Now that you have your own gym,
you've totally forgotten about us.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:31.476
Don't you ever think about
the times we spent together?

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.625
You're being too dramatic, Mai.

00:55:33.649 --> 00:55:37.122
I can just tell coach
that Kaew wanted to eat.

00:55:37.146 --> 00:55:39.704
He won't say anything.

00:55:39.728 --> 00:55:43.534
Fine, but only if there's squid for me.

00:55:43.558 --> 00:55:45.420
Then I'm ok with that.

00:55:45.444 --> 00:55:47.286
Yeah, there is.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.435
Go ahead and eat.

00:55:57.086 --> 00:56:02.073
Hey, have you two stopped
trying to one-up each other?

00:56:02.097 --> 00:56:06.559
You're so sweet now, I'm seriously jealous.

00:56:07.681 --> 00:56:15.000
Bung and Klao have been
posting couple pics nonstop!

00:56:17.994 --> 00:56:20.343
Jealous of what?

00:56:20.367 --> 00:56:25.371
Everyone shows love in their own way.

00:56:27.832 --> 00:56:30.339
Ait, try looking at it positively.

00:56:30.363 --> 00:56:35.231
Maybe Mawin is just shy.

00:56:35.255 --> 00:56:38.638
But when you're with him,

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:43.251
aren't those moments still special?

00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:48.131
Your love doesn't need
to look like anyone else's.

00:56:49.355 --> 00:56:52.951
Wow, Thun, that was deep.

00:56:52.975 --> 00:56:55.714
Super smooth.

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:59.406
Seafood's here, everyone!

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.258
Here, here.

00:57:01.282 --> 00:57:04.752
Whoa. Delivered right to your seats.

00:57:04.776 --> 00:57:07.253
Eat up, everyone!

00:57:07.277 --> 00:57:09.415
Come on, let's eat. It's insanely fresh.

00:57:09.439 --> 00:57:11.384
Let's eat.

00:57:25.902 --> 00:57:26.942
Ait.

00:57:26.966 --> 00:57:28.386
What?

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:31.782
Sneaking around like this
is kind of nice, it's exciting.

00:57:31.806 --> 00:57:34.060
I like it.

00:57:36.756 --> 00:57:38.756
Go on, eat.

00:57:48.512 --> 00:57:51.123
Hmm, Kaew?

00:57:51.147 --> 00:57:53.442
Who are you sending that picture to?

00:57:57.815 --> 00:57:59.815
Who are you sharing that with?

00:58:00.134 --> 00:58:02.134
Jay.

00:58:02.578 --> 00:58:04.308
Hmm?

00:58:04.332 --> 00:58:06.874
Aren't you protective of your little sister?

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.677
Jay's just my friend.

00:58:09.701 --> 00:58:12.655
Oh…

00:58:12.679 --> 00:58:14.630
Friend.

00:58:14.654 --> 00:58:16.561
I see.

00:58:16.585 --> 00:58:20.011
Man, I almost cried.

00:58:20.035 --> 00:58:22.394
Not worried at all, huh?

00:58:24.867 --> 00:58:26.597
This squid is insanely good.

00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:27.346
Really?

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:30.000
I took a bite and I was
instantly by the ocean, man.

00:58:30.024 --> 00:58:31.273
By the sea, huh?

00:58:31.297 --> 00:58:33.045
Have you had any squid yet?

00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:35.291
Not yet.

00:58:35.315 --> 00:58:39.673
Let me get it for you. Give her some.

01:00:11.807 --> 01:00:15.629
Tonight, I'm in charge, ok?

01:00:33.989 --> 01:00:37.286
You're really going to
let me sleep like this?

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:39.310
That's kind of mean, isn't it?

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.315
Oops, sorry.

01:00:59.228 --> 01:01:01.228
It's okay.

01:01:04.726 --> 01:01:06.726
Sorry.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.997
Come on, lie down
properly. I'll fix your pillow.

01:01:28.003 --> 01:01:29.979
Thun.

01:01:30.003 --> 01:01:31.817
Thun!

01:01:31.841 --> 01:01:34.140
Take that off!

01:01:34.164 --> 01:01:36.140
What are you doing?

01:01:36.164 --> 01:01:37.307
Hold still.

01:01:37.331 --> 01:01:39.334
Let go. Hold still.

01:01:39.358 --> 01:01:43.406
Thun, stop. What are you doing?

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:50.453
You know that I like to… win.

01:01:51.023 --> 01:01:53.023
Let go. Stop.

01:02:14.196 --> 01:02:16.196
Thun.

01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:30.728
Didn't you say stop?

01:02:30.752 --> 01:02:34.919
Come on already.

01:03:26.144 --> 01:03:28.489
It's okay, Keen.

01:03:30.103 --> 01:03:32.103
Aren't you cold?

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.675
Just getting to hug you
every night keeps me warm.

01:03:52.601 --> 01:04:00.601
Then let's stay like this
and hug forever, okay?

01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:05.031
Okay.

01:04:07.767 --> 01:04:09.767
Okay.
