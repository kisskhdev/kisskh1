WEBVTT

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.446
…wicked and evil.
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell…

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.948
-Vanquish all spirits…
-Mom!

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.289
Mom.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:27.922
-This isn't...
-Mom.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.006
what I wanted to do.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.509
I'm sorry.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.845
I'm sorry, Shaman.

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:41.310
I just wanted to survive.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.273
It was so I could survive.

00:01:57.243 --> 00:01:58.118
Open the door.

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.205
Open the door, you damned evil spirit!

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.457
Open up.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.251
Open the door.

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:08.420
You damned evil spirit!

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.297
Open the door!

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.628
Are you a good person?

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.297
What?

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.591
Are you a good person?

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:57.011
Well…

00:02:58.137 --> 00:02:58.971
I can't say.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.432
I'm a bad person.

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:03.726
What?

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.238
The evil spirit's gone.

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.574
We must find him and get rid of him.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:21.994
You can't go.

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:23.078
What?

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.247
You're not going.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.876
Who knows what the evil spirit will do?

00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.212
General Dongcheon was the last one.

00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:35.424
He just claimed his hundredth life.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.009
He has become an evil deity!

00:03:38.052 --> 00:03:39.678
Let go. Let go of me.

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.181
-Let me go.
-Yeomhwa.

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:44.391
-Do you have a plan?
-Let go!

00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:46.560
Do you know a way
other than dying with Bong-su?

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:49.396
She wanted to save you!

00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:56.320
My mom died while trying to save you!

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.407
You know,

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.660
I really hate you

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.287
with all my being.

00:04:08.332 --> 00:04:09.166
But I'll protect you.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.297
I'll protect you no matter what.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:28.852
Please just hear me out!

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.104
Man-sik!

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.440
Where is Heaven and Earth Fairy?

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:36.276
-I don't know if this is right.
-We have to find her.

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:38.696
Where is she right now?

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:46.870
What's this? Where am I?

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.006
Seong-A.

00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:05.055
Where are we?

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:07.891
Is this a dream?

00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:11.520
What is it?
Am I so pretty that it feels like a dream?

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.067
Now that you're up, let's go on our date.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.904
Stop it.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.783
One, two, three.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.165
You're taking selfies, aren't you?

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:37.463
There.

00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:39.965
Done.

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:42.718
Great. Thanks.

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.062
-You made a wish?
-Yeah.

00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:54.021
Let's go.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.463
So…

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.840
Where did Bong-su go?

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:24.093
I can't sense his presence anymore.

00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:26.386
He's gone.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:28.680
He's gone?

00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:29.807
Yeah.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.849
Where to? How?

00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:31.892
Shush.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.561
Talk about him, and he'll come back.

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:38.774
Flower Master.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.859
Man-sik, I know you're there.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.903
Hong Man-sik!

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.656
You don't need to untie me.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.409
Just hear me out! Man-sik!

00:06:50.494 --> 00:06:51.745
Hong Man-sik!

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:52.663
Ma'am!

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:54.748
MUST LIVE

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.792
Why do you keep calling me?

00:06:57.543 --> 00:06:58.794
Man-sik.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:06:59.837
You don't know.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.422
Heaven and Earth Fairy doesn't either.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:03.841
What do you mean?

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:06.635
Evil deities don't cause calamities.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.846
They're calamities themselves,

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.806
so they don't bring disasters.

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:15.727
If an evil deity resides in you,

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:18.397
things start to get plagued.

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:19.857
Seong-A!

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.025
First, plants start to wither.

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:24.027
Then, animals perish.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.697
In the end, people die.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:29.074
You must stop Heaven and Earth Fairy.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:33.245
She has no idea
what she's doing right now.

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.246
No.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.085
Yeomhwa.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:41.587
She knows.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.215
She knows everything.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.552
Did you get one of everything
from the vending machine?

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.887
Well,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.472
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I got one of each.

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:54.308
You don't know what I like?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.230
I like you.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.152
You are my first love.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.659
-You're also my--
-And…

00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:15.204
this is my first kiss.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.902
I'll come back
before the graduation ceremony.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:15.889
It's time to go now,

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.475
Bong-su.

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:35.367
Mother.

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:39.079
I'm surrounded by darkness,
and I can't see a thing.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:43.583
How can I tell
if I'm walking along the right path?

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:45.669
By leading the way.

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:51.133
You don't know what's awaiting,
so you walk in the front.

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.259
Will that

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.011
help me take the right path?

00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:56.513
You can then protect

00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:59.182
the ones behind you.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.143
Mother.

00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:03.854
I'll take the right path.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.064
I won't go astray.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.401
I promise to protect them.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:12.779
Bong-su.

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:15.240
Follow me from behind from now on.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.951
Why? I want to walk next to you.

00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:20.829
Stay behind and keep watch.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.707
Make sure I'm walking straight.

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:27.127
Okay, sure.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.644
I'll come back
before the graduation ceremony.

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.774
Seong-A.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:50.859
Seong-A.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.361
Seong-A!

00:10:52.903 --> 00:10:53.945
Seong-A…

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.030
Seong-A.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.284
Seong-A!

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:01.787
Park Seong-A!

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:07.334
Seong-A!

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:10.796
Seong-A!

00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:16.009
Park Seong-A.

00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:17.928
Park Seong-A...

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.081
I can't believe I'm in my last year.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.966
Seong-A left, and we became 12th graders.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.975
What's going on? Hey, Jin-ung.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.143
You're actually dating?

00:12:11.148 --> 00:12:13.275
It's seasoned perfectly.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.279
We were in different classes,
but we ate lunch together.

00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:19.030
Come on out!

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:20.282
-Who's this?
-Just get out.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.491
-What?
-What's this?

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:22.868
Get out already.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.161
What are you even doing?

00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:26.872
Do you have a death wish?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.790
-Here.
-Quit smoking.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:30.584
Okay?

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.961
-I smiled a lot over small things.
-Cigarettes, you know…

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.346
And Gyeon-U.

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:54.274
Come here.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.027
I'm proud of you. Well done.

00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:03.158
Well done, Gyeon-U.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:05.243
Hey.

00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:06.411
What?

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.626
You're the best.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.757
Bae Gyeon-U was doing well.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.674
A bit too well.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.557
He's more like a machine.

00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.600
Goodbye.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.976
Thank you.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:44.783
I found that so weird
that I quietly followed him a few times.

00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:50.121
GENERAL WARD B

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.039
Hui-na.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.133
Congratulations on going home.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.472
Do you still hate me?

00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:09.182
Yeah.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.393
I think I will forever.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.354
You know

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.440
the person responsible
for the fire in the dorm

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.693
was actually me.

00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:28.952
It's too late to come clean now,
and I didn't pay for what I did.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.414
I guess I'll suffer from guilt
for the rest of my life.

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:37.586
How was that possible?

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.089
Why didn't you tell anyone it was me?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.176
You wouldn't have done that

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.345
if it hadn't been for me.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.770
You're still a fool.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.523
And I'm still a coward.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:02.402
You think so?

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:07.699
But…

00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:11.786
I think it's about time

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.247
we both found happiness.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:18.501
I really want you

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.588
to be happy now.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:24.674
Why?

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.011
Because I'm your first-ever friend?

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:30.597
Yeah.

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:32.015
And…

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.185
I met and made another friend.

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:38.563
She taught me…

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:41.733
it's okay

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.027
to be happy.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:46.988
So what?

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:48.782
Are you happy now?

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.673
Give me your phone.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.391
Of all the bad things I did to you,

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.809
I think this was the worst.

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.186
Not letting you
save my number under my name.

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:24.943
CHOI HUI-NA

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.445
Don't take my calls anymore.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.572
That's the first thing
you should do to be happy.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.247
Hey.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.249
Archery.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.334
Will you go back into it?

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:48.091
Okay.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.844
See you at future competitions.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.696
I wouldn't have cared one bit

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.282
even if Gyeon-U
had met Seong-A alone in secret.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.744
That's how much I missed her.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.584
-You bought some.
-Do you need flowers?

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:23.710
We bought ours already.

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:26.421
That concludes
the 76th graduation ceremony

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.715
of Hwamok High School.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:29.799
One, two, three.

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.427
Dad, take it in portrait mode,
not landscape mode.

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.554
Come here. Let's take one together.

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.307
-We graduated!
-We graduated!

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:39.893
And...

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.521
We'd longed
for the graduation day to come.

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.148
One, two, three.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:47.609
Let's take one more.

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:51.112
"I want to attend
my high school graduation ceremony

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:52.697
and college entrance ceremony."

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:56.618
"I want to take a photo
with a flower bouquet."

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:00.747
This was Seong-A's wish.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.339
Stand up. Let's take a photo.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:21.601
Take it with this.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.603
In landscape mode.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.737
One, two, three.

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.822
Wait.

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.323
Hold this up a bit higher.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.700
About here. She's a bit taller than that.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.495
-No, this is the right height.
-It's not.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:41.746
One, two--

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.583
You're just clueless.
She's taller than this. Hold it up.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.627
She's not this tall. Your memory must be…

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.795
She's this tall.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.056
Down here. This is about it.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.016
This is too low.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.519
I think it should be a little higher.

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.522
I'll take the photo for you.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.941
I don't know. It's somewhere here.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.901
She's taking the photo.

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:13.361
Give me that.

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.616
On three, okay?

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.664
One.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:28.626
Two.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.006
Three.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.331
Seong-A. Wait.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.458
I'll come to you now.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.380
Long time no see.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.390
It seems I still scare you.

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:12.855
The deities have left.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.151
"The deities

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:18.861
have left?"

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.365
A shrine ends up like this
without its owner.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:26.327
Items that are no longer used
soon become worn down

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:28.162
and break.

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.375
Fairy God…

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.294
left her shaman completely.

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:37.714
That means…

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.051
the shaman is dead.

00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.225
No.

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.269
Seong-A isn't dead.

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:53.354
You're right.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.648
She isn't dead.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:59.360
That's why I find it odd.

00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:03.489
What are you trying to say?

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:07.118
We were once connected
through the Unify Spell.

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:09.287
So when she dies,

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:11.122
you and I are bound to know.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.543
She'll appear in our dreams all in white

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.128
to say a final goodbye.

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:21.257
But something's off.

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:23.760
Her patron deity is gone,

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:26.095
but she isn't dead.

00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:29.515
The evil spirit that's stuck to her…

00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:34.103
must be pulling something sly.

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:38.608
How can we find Seong-A--

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:40.526
We must find her as soon as possible…

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.114
before she starts harming people.

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:49.160
She'll do what?

00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:51.662
Seong-A will harm people?

00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:54.373
She's not like you!

00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:01.005
I wasn't like that from the start, either.

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:06.969
This won't work.

00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:09.597
I should find something else.

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:45.758
Hey, kid.

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:47.802
Handsome, you idiot!

00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:50.304
You're asking for divine punishment!

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:53.933
Darn it.

00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:57.562
It feels like I'm suffering one anyway.

00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:02.608
Okay, stop. I get it, fine.

00:24:02.692 --> 00:24:03.860
Point taken.

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:34.098
Wrap one around the arrow
before you shoot.

00:24:34.182 --> 00:24:35.766
You might be able to get ghosts.

00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:39.061
Thank you. I'll use these to find Seong-A.

00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:41.105
Whatever. Don't say another word. Just go.

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:44.233
Okay. I'll bring Seong-A
with me next time.

00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:45.276
Just go.

00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:10.301
He came as you said,
and I did as you asked.

00:25:11.177 --> 00:25:13.429
I'll pay for the amulets.

00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:15.890
If he comes back,

00:25:16.974 --> 00:25:17.850
give him more.

00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:19.810
It's not about the money.
Is this even right?

00:25:20.394 --> 00:25:21.854
Won't Handsome end up in danger too?

00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:23.481
I didn't put him up to this.

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:26.567
This is all him. You saw yourself too.

00:25:27.902 --> 00:25:29.695
He has to do something, anything.

00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:33.950
Okay. I'll call you back.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.968
May I ask

00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:53.761
what you're doing?

00:26:00.643 --> 00:26:01.602
Sure.

00:26:02.645 --> 00:26:03.688
We're family.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.982
Why keep secrets?

00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:17.034
The more evil you do,
the stronger the evil deity becomes.

00:26:17.994 --> 00:26:20.788
I've spent more than a year
looking for Heaven and Earth Fairy,

00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:23.582
and I couldn't find a trace of her.

00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:28.963
The moment I thought I'd found her,
she did something evil and got away.

00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:33.467
Her acts of evil…

00:26:37.722 --> 00:26:39.181
drove the Fairy God away from her.

00:26:43.686 --> 00:26:46.522
But we still have that boy.

00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:49.525
The boy the evil spirit resided in.

00:26:50.234 --> 00:26:51.986
The spirit's energy still lingers in him.

00:26:52.653 --> 00:26:54.447
Despite the evil spirit's departure

00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:56.741
and his lack of shamanic powers,

00:26:57.783 --> 00:26:59.243
he can still see and hear ghosts.

00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:01.078
And…

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:03.372
communicate with them.

00:27:07.168 --> 00:27:08.127
Perhaps…

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.757
we may still have a shot
at finding Heaven and Earth Fairy

00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:15.176
by using that unbreakable tie.

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:24.018
Gyeon-U would definitely help.

00:27:24.685 --> 00:27:28.022
You could tell him the truth
and ask for his help.

00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:30.066
Why go to all this trouble?

00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:41.118
I'll kill her when I find her.

00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:44.705
Would he still cooperate?

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.500
What?

00:27:48.042 --> 00:27:49.668
To exorcise the evil deity,

00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:51.337
Heaven and Earth Fairy

00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:53.422
has to die.

00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:53.858
Do you know this shaman?

00:28:58.529 --> 00:28:59.447
Looks like you do.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:02.741
So…

00:29:03.451 --> 00:29:05.286
how about you tell me everything you know?

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.169
I must find ghosts without faces

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:15.880
that want to serve the evil deity?

00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:22.303
Faceless Ghosts?

00:29:22.386 --> 00:29:24.346
You need to be rough with them.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.641
They literally have no faces.

00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:29.477
So

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.438
the one who gives them a face
becomes their master.

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.223
I got you a new face.

00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:08.682
Now I'm your master.

00:30:09.934 --> 00:30:10.809
Where is this girl?

00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.400
MAP OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:22.947
YEONCHEON-GUN, CHEORWON-GUN

00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:53.227

NONE IN INJE
DON'T GIVE UP, I'LL SAVE HER THIS TIME

00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.373
Gyeon-U, you little punk.

00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:16.375
Listen, you.

00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:18.294
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:31:20.129 --> 00:31:20.963
I'm sorry.

00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:22.590
Tell me.

00:31:22.673 --> 00:31:27.469
How come you haven't come to train
in the past two months?

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.681
You think you're all that
because you keep winning gold?

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:33.809
And why do you keep getting caught

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:36.186
by the police
for shooting arrows in the mountains?

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.813
In the middle of the night too.

00:31:46.155 --> 00:31:46.989
Come on.

00:31:47.698 --> 00:31:48.991
This is it.

00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:50.534
Talk to me.

00:31:50.618 --> 00:31:51.577
Tell me.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.372
I need to know what's going on
to cover for you.

00:31:57.791 --> 00:31:58.876
Come on, Gyeon-U.

00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:03.922
If you keep this up,
the Archery Association will penalize you.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.136
Coach.

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:10.095
Yes.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.682
Can you forget a girl who left

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:17.728
after promising to return no matter what?

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.066
The first kiss

00:32:23.025 --> 00:32:25.027
can't and shouldn't be a goodbye, right?

00:32:26.528 --> 00:32:27.613
So how could she…

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.075
not even appear in my dreams?

00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:39.375
I can see the world she'd see.

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:41.085
I don't get

00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:43.003
just how…

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.550
she kept a smile on her face
while seeing all this daily.

00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:51.887
Had I known,

00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:56.517
I wouldn't have told her I didn't like her
forcing herself to smile.

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:04.900
To be honest, her smile was lovely.

00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:08.696
I get it.

00:33:10.197 --> 00:33:12.116
All that's happened
is that a girl left you,

00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:15.536
but the whole world
has turned gray, hasn't it?

00:33:16.495 --> 00:33:17.579
Right?

00:33:19.832 --> 00:33:21.417
That's love for you.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.085
Love.

00:33:24.712 --> 00:33:28.215
That's what love does to you.

00:33:58.454 --> 00:34:00.080
I'm your master now.

00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:03.041
Repeat exactly what you told that boy,

00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:05.002
word for word.

00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:37.409
I pray you will find your way to paradise

00:34:37.493 --> 00:34:39.703
and be reborn as a person in this world.

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.040
Three, two, one.

00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:28.252
Three, two, one.

00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:30.963
Three, two, one.

00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:32.381
Three, two...

00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:33.882
one.

00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:02.494
You all

00:36:03.787 --> 00:36:05.914
must move on to a better place.

00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:15.257
Why waste time and energy
to console a whopping 100 souls…

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.724
when you can die and be done with it
after one entreaty to the King of Hell?

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:35.235
Hey.

00:36:36.028 --> 00:36:37.237
Stay out of my way.

00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:39.698
Or I'll kill you.

00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:44.161
You're basically a ghost now.

00:36:55.547 --> 00:36:56.548
Let's go.

00:36:57.424 --> 00:36:58.508
Hey.

00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:00.802
Let me go. Let go of me!

00:37:01.303 --> 00:37:02.596
Would you let go if you were me?

00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:06.683
I don't want to hurt you. Let go.

00:37:06.767 --> 00:37:08.268
Enough with the show.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.313
Come with me quietly.

00:37:18.153 --> 00:37:20.364
Go! Go on, Seong-A!

00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:22.449
No!

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:27.537
Stop! No!

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:30.958
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you?

00:37:42.928 --> 00:37:45.806
I'm risking an expulsion
from the Archery Association.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.035
That was our last chance to catch her.

00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:12.874
Do you even realize
what you unleashed into the world?

00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:16.586
If you hadn't tried to turn
Bong-su into an evil deity,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.923
-I wouldn't have had to--
-That's why I'm trying to correct it all!

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.845
Seong-A…

00:38:26.054 --> 00:38:27.305
Seong-A wouldn't have resorted

00:38:28.098 --> 00:38:29.474
to such harsh ways.

00:38:31.018 --> 00:38:32.561
She would've found a way…

00:38:34.563 --> 00:38:36.106
that wouldn't be so hurtful.

00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:38.442
So…

00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:42.696
you should find another way,
just like she would.

00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:47.993
I feel so sorry for you.

00:38:50.537 --> 00:38:52.956
An exorcism is now the only way to…

00:38:56.084 --> 00:38:56.918
No.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.921
Even that's not an option now

00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.592
since we've lost all means to catch her.

00:39:13.435 --> 00:39:14.478
Gyeon-U.

00:39:16.313 --> 00:39:18.356
If she comes to see you,

00:39:20.484 --> 00:39:21.943
it will be to kill you.

00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:26.782
By any chance,

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:30.285
if you run into her, run away.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.288
Run away and call me.

00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:37.084
That's the only way you'll live.

00:40:23.964 --> 00:40:25.132
As for the interview…

00:40:25.215 --> 00:40:26.049
2 YEARS LATER

00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:27.884
…we'll only ask the questions
we sent you earlier.

00:40:27.968 --> 00:40:31.179
So there's no need to be nervous.

00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:35.142
Hello, I'm Bae Gyeon-U.

00:40:35.225 --> 00:40:36.059
BAE GYEON-U
RECURVE, JANGAN CITY HALL

00:40:36.143 --> 00:40:37.185
Say a bit more.

00:40:37.269 --> 00:40:40.147
So I shoot with a recurve bow.

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:42.607
I'm happy.

00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:44.359
I'm over the moon.

00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:50.031
He's terrible at interviews, isn't he?

00:40:50.657 --> 00:40:52.117
Dude, lower that hand. Come on.

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:53.451
Hand down.

00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:54.536
INTRODUCE YOURSELF

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:55.453
That's it.

00:40:55.537 --> 00:40:56.538
Okay, great.

00:40:56.621 --> 00:41:00.458
Is winning gold at the Olympics
your dream, then?

00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:02.294
WHAT'S YOUR DREAM?

00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:05.797
Winning the gold medal
at the Olympic Games is my goal.

00:41:07.299 --> 00:41:08.633
My dream is something else.

00:41:08.717 --> 00:41:09.718
My dream

00:41:11.052 --> 00:41:13.680
is to see my first love again.

00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:18.351
This interview has become
all sweet and romantic all of a sudden.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.230
If you had to choose between winning gold
and your first love,

00:41:22.314 --> 00:41:23.565
what would you choose?

00:41:24.274 --> 00:41:25.233
My first love.

00:41:26.359 --> 00:41:27.527
A video message?

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:32.490
I miss you…

00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:35.994
Seong-A.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.539
Punk.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.666
No holding back, huh?

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:10.070
-Stop right there!
-Wait, Ji-ho.

00:42:10.153 --> 00:42:12.364
-Come on.
-Stop it. What are you doing?

00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:13.531
I'm sorry, Ji-ho.

00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:15.575
I'm so sorry. I mean that.

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.336
11TH HANRAGI ARCHERY COMPETITION

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.852
My goodness. Will you knock first?

00:42:42.936 --> 00:42:44.813
What are you doing here?

00:42:45.647 --> 00:42:46.606
This is my home.

00:42:48.275 --> 00:42:50.443
You should've called to say you'd come.

00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:58.285
This is my place,
but I should call you before coming here?

00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.997
Did you come here planning to move in?

00:43:02.497 --> 00:43:04.291
Yeah. You don't mind, do you?

00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.126
I do mind.

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:07.210
Oh, right.

00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:09.379
Will you have dinner at home?

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:11.673
I'm not sure.

00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:15.093
Come home in time for dinner.
I'll cook something nice.

00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:17.345
Fix this if you don't have anything to do.

00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:19.556
See you. Rest up.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.391
See you later.

00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:30.150
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:32.235 --> 00:43:34.321
She passed away?

00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:36.865
Okay.

00:43:37.407 --> 00:43:38.908
I'll come over.

00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:53.256
The elder shaman prayed for you both

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.175
until the day she passed.

00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:04.017
The deities

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.102
will protect both you and Seong-A.

00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:07.729
Consider yourself

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:11.316
as fragile as glass
and be careful for the time being.

00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:12.442
Can you do that?

00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:15.278
I'll try.

00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:20.867
Rather than leaving it all alone
in Lady Fairy's room,

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.496
I thought it would be better
to have you keep it.

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:27.874
Okay. I'll take good care of it.

00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:37.801
I'm sure she's fine.

00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:44.641
She must be, right?

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:48.478
Take all the time you need.

00:44:48.561 --> 00:44:49.521
Yes, ma'am.

00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:41.072
PARK SEONG-A
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

00:46:04.554 --> 00:46:05.847
What a shame.

00:46:06.556 --> 00:46:07.891
If this were the Joseon Period,

00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:10.059
the king would build a monument
to praise your devotion.

00:46:10.602 --> 00:46:12.854
Would it be something else
since you're a man?

00:46:15.148 --> 00:46:17.901
You haven't changed one bit.
That's good to see.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.987
-Are you being sarcastic?
-You started it.

00:46:24.199 --> 00:46:26.993
Did you have any dreams?

00:46:31.164 --> 00:46:31.998
No.

00:46:33.708 --> 00:46:36.544
There was a slight pause.
That's suspicious.

00:46:37.879 --> 00:46:41.007
You said if I see her in my dreams
that would mean she's dead.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.592
That's the best-case scenario.

00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:45.094
Then we can just collect her body.

00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:49.182
Glare at me all you want,

00:46:49.766 --> 00:46:51.226
but your ally now is me, not her.

00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:55.355
If she appears in a dream,
ask where she is.

00:46:55.939 --> 00:46:58.316
We must collect her body
and cleanse the area.

00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:02.070
If you see her in real life,
run away and don't look back.

00:47:02.946 --> 00:47:03.947
And call me.

00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:08.743
What if I don't want to call you?

00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:11.162
Gyeon-U.

00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:14.707
You've never called me
for your own good anyway.

00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:16.918
Don't call if you don't want to.

00:47:17.752 --> 00:47:19.796
I'm sure you'll love joining
your grandmother sooner.

00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:36.521
I'm back.

00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:38.273
That was quick. I won't be long.

00:47:38.815 --> 00:47:39.816
I won't eat.

00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:41.901
But it's spicy stir-fried pork.

00:47:57.709 --> 00:47:58.668
Did you have

00:47:59.627 --> 00:48:00.753
any dreams?

00:48:09.846 --> 00:48:10.972
If she appears in a dream,

00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:12.765
ask where she is.

00:48:13.725 --> 00:48:14.892
Seong-A's dream.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.896
A dream that has Seong-A in it.

00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:26.529
There's something
I didn't tell Yeomhwa earlier.

00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:29.991
I've been having

00:48:30.992 --> 00:48:31.993
this dream.

00:48:37.832 --> 00:48:38.666
I'm here again.

00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:56.225
A 12th-grade classroom
without a class number.

00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:05.777
CLASS MOTTO
LET'S GET INTO A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.111
A weird class motto.

00:49:23.169 --> 00:49:24.462
Ji-ho and I are in the same class.

00:49:25.672 --> 00:49:27.674
We were in different classes
in 12th grade, though.

00:49:32.345 --> 00:49:34.972
PARK SEONG-A

00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:40.061
Seong-A.

00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:43.815
Are you doing okay?

00:49:57.495 --> 00:49:59.038
So this is

00:50:00.123 --> 00:50:02.875
what the classroom looks like
from your seat.

00:50:15.722 --> 00:50:16.848
That's a nice drawing.

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:29.944
Gyeon-U.

00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:33.197
Hey, Gyeon-U. Wake up.

00:50:35.324 --> 00:50:37.660
Are you a newborn? You dozed off already?

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:39.662
Get up. It's time for dinner.

00:50:40.788 --> 00:50:42.039
Have you ever experienced

00:50:43.666 --> 00:50:44.709
having a dream

00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:46.961
that doesn't feel like yours?

00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:49.046
As if…

00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.550
you were in someone else's dream.

00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:57.054
My dear friend has reached
new heights of nonsense.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.016
I think

00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:03.561
I end up in Seong-A's dream sometimes.

00:51:05.772 --> 00:51:08.566
I have dreams of Seong-A

00:51:09.484 --> 00:51:11.110
that doesn't have her in it.

00:51:20.578 --> 00:51:21.829
For goodness' sake.

00:51:21.913 --> 00:51:23.164
What the heck?

00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:25.958
Why do you keep hiding? Just go meet him.

00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:28.795
What if I do and end up hurting him?

00:51:30.213 --> 00:51:33.549
We're in a dream.
What harm could you possibly do?

00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:36.427
A dream's a dream because you can do
whatever you want in it.

00:51:36.511 --> 00:51:38.888
And if anyone were to harm him,
it would be me, not you.

00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:42.225
We never know.

00:51:43.351 --> 00:51:46.229
Gyeon-U and Ji-ho
seem to be living together, right?

00:51:46.896 --> 00:51:48.523
They must still be close.

00:51:49.148 --> 00:51:50.149
That's great.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.152
Who cares if they're close or not?

00:51:56.072 --> 00:51:58.407
Is it because Gyeon-U sat here?

00:51:59.367 --> 00:52:00.451
The seat's warm.

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:02.912
By the way,

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.706
why did he have to sit in your chair?

00:52:06.207 --> 00:52:07.166
What a weirdo.

00:52:09.752 --> 00:52:10.670
Bong-su.

00:52:13.923 --> 00:52:15.508
This is good enough for me.

00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:18.261
Seeing him from time to time like this
is more than enough.

00:52:24.892 --> 00:52:26.853
Did you draw that?

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.522
That's pretty good.

00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:37.071
You were drawing it
until a short while ago.

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:51.127
That's right.

00:52:52.962 --> 00:52:55.631
I should finish it.

00:53:07.852 --> 00:53:10.229
How do you know if it's a dream
about her if she's not in it?

00:53:10.313 --> 00:53:11.522
I just do.

00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:13.441
I can

00:53:14.609 --> 00:53:15.526
just tell.

00:53:23.576 --> 00:53:24.493
That drawing

00:53:25.453 --> 00:53:27.830
of the seaside seemed familiar.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.502
We were just talking about your dream.
What do you mean, seaside?

00:53:34.086 --> 00:53:35.796
I've seen that seaside…

00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:38.633
That seaside…

00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:49.018
FLOWER MASTER'S SHRINE

00:53:52.146 --> 00:53:53.230
You want me

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:55.191
to curse him?

00:54:02.323 --> 00:54:05.826
I may be great at making
effective amulets, but I can't do this.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.161
I can't. I won't.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.830
This is Bae Gyeon-U.

00:54:09.914 --> 00:54:11.749
Young and handsome,
Heaven and Earth Fairy's first love.

00:54:15.962 --> 00:54:16.879
Exactly.

00:54:18.798 --> 00:54:20.049
I hate his guts.

00:54:20.132 --> 00:54:22.635
Do it yourself if you must.
You're powerful.

00:54:22.718 --> 00:54:23.719
I'm too powerful.

00:54:23.803 --> 00:54:26.180
If I curse him, he'll die.

00:54:30.142 --> 00:54:33.562
Anyway, where's Heaven and Earth Fairy?
Why are you out here?

00:54:34.772 --> 00:54:36.857
If I tell you, will you curse him for me?

00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:39.443
I shouldn't even bother.

00:54:39.527 --> 00:54:41.904
Darn it. I knew you wouldn't help.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.073
I'm off.

00:54:44.156 --> 00:54:45.032
Already?

00:54:45.116 --> 00:54:48.744
It's bad for you if I stay too long.
Do you want to die an early death?

00:54:48.828 --> 00:54:51.414
You've become much cruder
since we last met.

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.377
How's finding your name going?

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.213
Darn you.
I'd have crossed over if I'd found it

00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:00.798
instead of coming to see you.

00:55:01.757 --> 00:55:03.551
You're so annoying.

00:55:03.634 --> 00:55:05.678
Whatever. I'm getting out of here.

00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:08.055
Looking at your ugly mug
disgusts me every moment.

00:55:08.597 --> 00:55:10.516
You're crazy.
It's not like I asked you to come.

00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:12.977
Hello? Are you in, Flower Master?

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:13.936
Speak of the devil.

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:14.854
Are you in?

00:55:14.937 --> 00:55:16.022
Sure, hang on!

00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:18.024
Wait a minute!

00:55:18.107 --> 00:55:18.941
Hey, you. Come here.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:21.360
-Get in here.
-No, wait.

00:55:21.444 --> 00:55:23.696
Won't I die in here?
Don't you know of Crown Prince Sado?

00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:25.281
I don't know. Shut up and get inside.

00:55:25.364 --> 00:55:26.782
-Hurry.
-Damn it.

00:55:26.866 --> 00:55:27.867
Hang on!

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:30.411
Oh, dear.

00:55:34.582 --> 00:55:35.916
Come on in!

00:55:58.314 --> 00:56:00.149
Save yourself energy.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.526
We need the deity to come back.

00:56:03.778 --> 00:56:04.695
Until then,

00:56:06.197 --> 00:56:08.949
the shrine will only become eerier,
no matter how hard you clean it.

00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:11.410
I know that.

00:56:11.952 --> 00:56:13.579
But it bothers me

00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:17.374
to just let it be.

00:56:23.255 --> 00:56:25.091
You put in so much effort and work.

00:56:26.258 --> 00:56:27.885
I hope the deity returns quickly.

00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:40.856
It seems the elder shaman
prayed for your little one

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.775
until the day she passed.

00:56:44.652 --> 00:56:45.528
The old hag.

00:56:47.655 --> 00:56:49.990
Did she think I'd thank her for it?

00:56:51.784 --> 00:56:53.661
It seems you are feeling thankful, though.

00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:00.918
What are those?

00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:05.297
These are the items

00:57:06.173 --> 00:57:07.550
belonging to people

00:57:08.134 --> 00:57:10.219
the elder shaman prayed for until the end.

00:57:15.391 --> 00:57:17.601
This is Lady Fairy's.

00:57:19.478 --> 00:57:20.771
Maybe not.

00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:22.815
She used it for the Human Amulet spell,

00:57:22.898 --> 00:57:25.025
so maybe I should say
it belongs to Gyeon-U.

00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:32.575
If that's the case,

00:57:33.075 --> 00:57:34.910
you should give it to Gyeon-U.

00:57:43.627 --> 00:57:45.796
That way, we can reconnect

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.882
the ties that have been broken.

00:57:50.009 --> 00:57:50.843
What?

00:57:53.012 --> 00:57:55.639
Never mind. I was distracted for a second.

00:58:02.855 --> 00:58:05.733
She said if Seong-A
appears in my dream dressed in white,

00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:08.235
it means she's dead.

00:58:09.278 --> 00:58:10.946
I was also told

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:14.241
that because we were once bound
by a strong spell,

00:58:15.326 --> 00:58:17.786
I should see it in a dream
if anything bad happened to her.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.956
Of course.
The dead would visit you in a dream.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.833
Damn it, it's suffocating in here.

00:58:23.626 --> 00:58:24.793
I might actually die.

00:58:24.877 --> 00:58:27.463
But I'm positive

00:58:27.546 --> 00:58:28.589
that Seong-A's fine.

00:58:30.007 --> 00:58:32.009
That's what my gut tells me.

00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:34.428
I know it sounds weird,

00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:36.764
but it feels like she's close by.

00:58:36.847 --> 00:58:38.098
Even now,

00:58:38.182 --> 00:58:40.517
I feel like she's right next to me.

00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:43.479
Really?

00:58:44.271 --> 00:58:46.607
Oh, and whenever I have a dream,

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:48.609
I can sense Seong-A's presence.

00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:50.152
Very strongly, too.

00:58:50.236 --> 00:58:52.947
When the heck will he leave?

00:58:58.494 --> 00:58:59.912
What was that sound?

00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:01.080
Wait, what?

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.874
What noise? I didn't hear anything.

00:59:06.585 --> 00:59:09.672
There's no one else in that dream,

00:59:10.798 --> 00:59:11.882
and I don't see her.

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.928
But it feels like Seong-A is there.

00:59:21.433 --> 00:59:22.810
-There's something in there.
-In there?

00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:24.853
There's nothing in there. Nothing at all.

00:59:24.937 --> 00:59:26.272
This is what you heard.

00:59:26.355 --> 00:59:28.440
-I think there is something.
-No, hey. There's nothing.

00:59:28.524 --> 00:59:30.359
-Oh, screw it.
-There's something in…

00:59:35.864 --> 00:59:37.366
You're a talker, aren't you?

00:59:38.117 --> 00:59:38.951
Seong-A.

00:59:45.708 --> 00:59:46.792
Seong-A.

00:59:55.134 --> 00:59:56.635
That rascal.

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.515
Hey!

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:03.559
Hey, wait up.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:04.935
Dang it.

01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:06.353
Hey!

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:08.689
Hey, you.

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:10.858
Stop running.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:17.072
Darn it. I don't know anymore.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:42.723
Damn, I can't move over.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.769
"Damn"?

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:52.691
Seong-A…

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:55.069
Hey.

01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.988
I'm obviously not her.

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:44.785
Her spirit vessel is cracking.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.745
Shamanistic practice's
all about equivalent exchange.

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:48.539
When one life withers,

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.749
another blooms.

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:52.334
Die in the shaman's place.

01:01:52.418 --> 01:01:54.128
I'm begging you.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.462
What do I have to do?

01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:57.381
By the time you wake up,

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.341
it will all be over.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.010
It's not fair
that I'm the only one to die.

01:02:02.094 --> 01:02:04.471
What makes you think
you're the only one to die today?

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:05.889
Where is Yeomhwa?

01:02:06.974 --> 01:02:08.559
I'll help you cross over without pain.

01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:10.727
You shouldn't be around me.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:11.645
Goodbye.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.193
