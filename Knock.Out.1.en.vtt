Come here.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.920
Let me go.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.200
Let me go!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.320
Let me go.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.240
You’ve got some nerves.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.400
(Uncle Petch)

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.040
(Keen, where are you?)

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.000
(I’ve sent Thun after you.
Have you met him yet?)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.040
I think...

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.280
I found him.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.560
Just you wait!

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.440
Let’s go.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.240
Are you okay?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.560
Okay.

Next person.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.640
Kirin Rojanamethipong.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.680
It's me.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.400
Recently graduated…

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.960
No experience.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.640
You all came to apply to my company today…

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.400
Do you know what our company does?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.680
The company imports electronic parts.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.680
And also relates to crypto coins,
providing coin trading services.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
And most importantly,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.320
this is the first company
that produced Thai coins.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.160
Incorrect.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.760
DH Corp.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.320
does not have its own coins,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.520
but rather chooses
to invest in other coins.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.840
Additionally, it provides
a full-service crypto wallet.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.800
DH Wallet T-2

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.400
is the latest model of hardware

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.920
that needs to be encrypted
with 24 English words,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.160
making it so even
a supercomputer can't decipher it.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.640
Therefore, it is the safest.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.480
Alright.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.080
Thank you very much for coming today.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.840
we will notify you via email.

- Okay.
- Okay.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.880
Recently graduated, so talented.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.160
What a show-off.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.400
Since I lack experience,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.240
I've got to prepared everything.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.520
It's you.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.000
Don't overthink it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.760
He was joking.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.200
(Are you Kirin?)

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.920
Yes.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.200
Would you like to see
your father's face one last time

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.280
before he is placed in the coffin?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040
He was attacked by a large dog.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.320
It might not be a pleasant sight.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.360
You can close it now.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.920
It's alright, Keen.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.480
He rested in peace now.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.000
Keen, that's alright.

The account number is on the bill here.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.880
It's all set.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.000
Okay.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.760
Got it.

Please accept my condolence.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.520
My condolence as well.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.480
Are you alright?

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.960
Sure?

He is my dad's friend.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.520
Your dad's friend?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.680
He is a boxing coach who trained
the Tiger Taming Canon, you know.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.520
Hello.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.280

Do you remember me?

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.920
I'm Petch, your father's friend.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.400
This is Marwin, my son.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.840
I remember.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.840
If you are ever in trouble,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.200
you can tell me.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.560
When Kanchit was around,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.400

Yeah, okay. I'll be there soon.

I'm sorry. I'll come back
to help you soon.

It's really alright.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.120
I have to go.

You must be busy with the funeral.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.880
I'll get someone to help you.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.720
You don’t have to.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.720

I'm here to collect your father's debt.

What debt?

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.880
What debt?

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.960
The debt your father borrowed from us
and then defaulted on.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.600
What debt?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.600
Don't be coy...

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.880
and try to run away, huh?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.680
Where’s the proofs?

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.520
Nonsense.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.760
After the funeral ends,

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.360
let's take Keen home.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.480
Where did he go?

Come here.

Let me go.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.080
Let me go!

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.040
Search him!

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.880
Let me go.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.160
I said, let me go!

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.800
Let me go.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.560

Give my money back!

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.200
Let me go.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.920
Can you believe this?

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.680
Money from Petchsak Camp.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.560
What a tiny little help
from your dad’s friend.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.680
Give it back.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.320
You scare me?

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.600
Give me back.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.800
Let me go.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.160
Do you want it back?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.240
Come and get it.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.520
Give my money back.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.400
Give my money back.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.480
- What the heck!
- Give my money back.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:53.960
No way.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.320
Hey, what's up with Thun?

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.720
I don't think he's coming, dad.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.080
Don't do it.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.240
Don't.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.800
Don’t you think I can fight you?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.200
What are you gonna do?

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080
Leave me alone.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.840
What do you think you’re gonna do, brat?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.680
Thun is a weird man.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.080
Will he be here or not?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.400
Will he fight or not?

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.360
I have no idea what he's thinking.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.120
You already know.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.120
Since that incident, he refused to do anything.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.200
Just leave him alone, dad.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.840
Asking for trouble?

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.120
Let me go.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.680
We can end this easily if you pay.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.600
Why?

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.400
Do you want this so bad? huh?

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.840
If you want it, take it.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.120
Come get it.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.240
Tiger Taming Cannon.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.280
Who do you think you are?

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.920
(Uncle Petch)

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.720
Let me go.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.880
Let me go.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.440
Let me go.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.080
(Uncle Petch)

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.400
Just you wait!

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:29.680
Go.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.280
I think...

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.320
I found him.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.560
Are you okay?

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.720
Okay.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.480
Dad, there they are.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.480
Thun, Keen.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.080
Keen, Thun.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.520
What happened?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.320
Probably got jumped?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.800
Two days ago, I heard news that
robbers were around here.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.760
Which way did they go?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.280
I'll give them the works by myself.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.360
You go grab Boong and Ait.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.040
Which way did they go, Keen?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.200
Thun?

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.120
The thugs said they came
to collect my dad's debt.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.920
I don't know if it's true.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.000
Besides the wounds on the face,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.960
are there any other wounds
or internal injuries?

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.720
Here's the thing.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.320
I'll make a referral letter for you to get
a medical check-up at the hospital,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.560
and after you finish the check-up,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.040
you bring the medical certificate
back to the police station.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.680
About the loan shark,

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.280
if there are evidences or witnesses,

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.560
come back and talk to me again.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.240
It's settled then.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.440
You.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520
Hey, you.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.560
Okay.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.520
Does it hurt?

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.160
Your name is Thun, right?

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.480
My...

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.400
My name is Keen.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.480
Thank you.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:13.960
Well, let me.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.960
Thank you.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.400
Be careful.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.880
What will you do next?

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.240
Should we head back
to the boxing camp first?

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.720
(Petchsak Boxing Camp)

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.920
Soy milk for you.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.160
Thank you.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.640
Keen,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.200
you can stay here as long as you want.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.120
I don't mind.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.840
I think that staying at the flat
won't be safe.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.080
Uncle Petch,

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.280
if my dad is really in debt,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.720
what kind of debt could it be?

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.040
Or is it the debt from when
your mom was sick.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.200
But my dad sold the house
for that debt a long time ago.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.840
He might be afraid you'd worry,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.640
so he didn't want to tell you the truth.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.720
But...

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400
Never mind.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.280
Keen,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.760
for tonight,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.440
you sleep over in Thun's room.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.880
Why does it have to be me?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.320
You've been sleeping alone
for a long time, haven't you?

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.360
I can sleep anywhere, Uncle Petch.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.200
Come on, just go sleep with Thun.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.200
You can sleep here tonight.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.840
Wait.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.920
I'm sorry for bothering you.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.280
Once I get a job,

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320
I’ll be on my own.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.440
Keen.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.160
Come pray your mother.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.960
Yes, just a moment, Dad.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.320
Come light the incense.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.880
Yes.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.040
I've finished, Dad.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.720
Thank you.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.760
I'll be home late tonight, Keen.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.560
For the food left on the table,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.120
you can have it warmed up
in the microwave, Keen.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.520
Please pack some to eat
at the station, too, Dad.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.000
I can't finish it all alone.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.680
If you can't finish it,
you can save it for two days.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.560
I'm going to work a part-time job today.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.440
Are you tired?

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.880
If you're tired,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.400
you can quit the job.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.640
Just Keen alone,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.840
I can take care of you.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.480
Dad,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.680
it's okay, I'm fine.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.720
I want to lighten your burden.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.800
Remember this,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.600
I will always be by your side.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.640
Just focus on your duties, Keen.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.040
I will wait to see your success, Keen.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.320
Sure, Dad.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.280
Just wait and see.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.800
If she were here, it'd be better.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.120
Let's go to work.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:40.320
(The applicant passed the first round of interview and
has an appointment for the second interview with DH Corp at 10:30 AM.)

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.600
(Petchsak Boxing Camp)

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.600
Speak of the devil.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.480
I'm here.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.520
You took long enough.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.080
Come, come.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.520
Here comes the food.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:21.840
Keen,

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.200
come eat together.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:26.760
Okay.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.480
Come, come.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.880
His name is Keen.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.600
He's the son of Sergeant Chit, my friend.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.000
He will stay with us during this period.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.840
Have a seat.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:48.920
Hello.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.000
I'm Ait, a boxer here.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.200
And this is Boong.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.040
Let's eat.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.720
And what about the other boxers?

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.640
It's just us.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.880
The other boxers have moved
to another camp following Typhoon.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.160
Hey.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.880
Where did you sleep last night?

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.200
Thun is always like this?

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.720
Why do you want to know?

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.080
Just ignore him.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.480
Don't think too much about it.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.520
Thun is really just like this.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.360
Let's eat.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.000
You can dig in.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.080
Get in the car, kid.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.960
You've got the wrong person.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.200
Where are you going?

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.040
Let me go.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:03.600
Hello, Kanchit's son.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.720
We finally meet.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:09.760
What are you saying?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.440
You can pay off the debt now,
and everything will be over.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.840
Bullshit!

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.800
I don't even know who the fuck you are.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.240
Why should I believe you guys?

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.800
Let me go.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:33.040
(Please, my son is about
to graduate. I really need the money.)

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.520
(That house means a lot
to Keen and me.)

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.120
Do you believe now
that your dad owes me?

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.360
You can't do this to me.
I’ll call the cops.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.040
Are you really going to
call the cops?

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.520
You know what?

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.760
Everyone at the station
owes me money.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.880
Do you think the cop will help you?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.720
This is just an appetizer.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.200
He's looking at my face.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.560
What are you gonna do?

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.200
I'll do this.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.160
Come.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.200
Come here.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.280
Come here.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.200
Mark my words.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.960
You got this,

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.640
because you owe Ms. Muay.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:47.960
What are you gonna do?

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.280
Let me go.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.440
Let me go.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.080
What are you doing?

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.560
Let me go.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.360
Let me go.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.320
Stop.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.000
I said stop. Let me go.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.000
Let me go.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.280
So, you’re gonna pay up?

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.920
Where the hell I’m going to find the money?

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.680
Petchsak.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.480
It's Petchsak.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.640
The boxing camp.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.480
They've got a lot of money
from The Cannon, right?

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.040
You should

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.560
get money from that boxing camp
and pay me back.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.680
Otherwise,

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.480
you’ll get this over and over again.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.560
You tough?

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.960
He's looking at my face again.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.240
Try to consider it.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.040
Aww, you're looking at my face.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:08.920
Get out.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.960
Find the way back by yourself, kid.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.080
Hello.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.120
(HR Department, DH Corp., hello)

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.280
I have an appointment
for a second interview,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.120
but I have got an accident.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.840
Could I still make it now?

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.840
(Oh dear! Why don't you
call us tomorrow?)

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.200
( We already got someone,
maybe next time.)

( Keen, it's late now. Are you alright?
Why haven't you come back?)

Hey.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.720
Do you want to go to the hospital?

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.120
Let's go back.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:14.920
Go.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.920
Thun.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.560
Can you stay by my side for now?

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.120
Hang in there.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.120
Done.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.240
Was it those guys again?

Yes.

Their boss's name is Ms. Muay.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.960
Darn it.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.800
What made him choose

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.040
to borrow money from Ms. Muay?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.320
Chit was like this.

He wouldn’t slip a word
when he got into trouble.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.400
Thun,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.640
from now on, please take care of Keen.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.640
Just pity him.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.120
Look at him now.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.080
Thank you for dressing my wound.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.320
It's nothing.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.960
Uncle Petch,

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.480
do you have any work for me?

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.040
In the camp?

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.080
Yes.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.480
What can you do?

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.920
What are you doing?

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.400
I come to sleep with you.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.720
Go sleep properly.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.600
If anything happens to you,

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.000
Coach will blame me.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.760
Then why don't you go to sleep
in the room properly?

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.000
Okay.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.840
Then I’ll sleep in my room.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.280
Uncle Petch told us
to sleep together, didn't he?

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.200
Sleep by yourself.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.400
I don’t want to sleep with anyone.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.520
Hey.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.840
What's wrong with you?

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.920
What's with you?

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.680
Do you have feelings for me?

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.920
Is that why you don't dare
to sleep together?

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.520
Listen.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.840
I want to sleep alone.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.760
But you have to take care
of me, don't you?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.240
Do I have to take care in your bed too?

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.640
If it's too troublesome,

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.800
then I'll go back to sleep at the flat.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.520
If you dare, go ahead.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:38.800
Fine.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:57.960
Whatever.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.160
If you want to sleep here, then sleep.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:08.920
Go sleep on the bed.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.000
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:13.760
No.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.640
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:48.760
(Boxing News: Thun raises the boxing belt.
News: Thun wins many competitions.)

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:59.040
(Boxing News: Tiger Taming Cannon, the undefeated boxer,
is so strong that no one wants to fight him.)

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.280
Hey, you.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:06.840
Did you doze off?

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.320
I know you're awake.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.000
What is it?

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.720
No boxing matches lately?

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.720
No.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.080
Why?

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.040
Don't you want to fight?

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.480
I do.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.200
So,

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.000
do you want to fight anyone in particular?

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.840
Anyone will do.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.640
If I can find some matches
for you, will you fight?

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.320
Stop questioning and sleep.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.600
Okay.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.200
Good night.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:49.400
(Typhoon, former number 2 boxer of the Petchsak Boxing Camp,
won the Muay Thai Championship for the new P. White Tiger Camp)

00:51:49.400 --> 00:52:02.080
(P. White Tiger Camp
welcoming Typhoon Roaring Sky)

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.520
(Typhoon Roaring Sky, former friend of Tiger Taming Cannon, won the championship
again.)

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520
Are you feeling better?

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.200
(Since moving to P. White Tiger Camp, it seems his life has only been on the rise.)

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:36.640
(I think if the two fight, it's definitely
going to be intense. I really want to see it.)

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.120
True.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.280
Cash cow.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.040
Why?

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.160
Why are you checking out?

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.400
What are you looking for?

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.760
I saw that he used to be
in the Petchsak Boxing Camp.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.080
Alright.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.480
Can you tell me why he left?

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.480
Please tell me. I want to know.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.800
Why? What happened?

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.320
I won't tell you.

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.920
Bro, tell me.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.520
Win,

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.440
why are you sitting
and playing games here?

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.800
I asked you to get the scale
to be fixed. Is it fixed yet?

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.280
Oh, Dad.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.080
I'm not playing games? I'm trading.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.200
Don't go yet.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.480
Tell me first.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.680
Nice, sweep well.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.320
Keep it strong.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.320
You sure like giving orders.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.120
Whose car is that?

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.080
Are they here to see coach?

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.920
Hey, I know her.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.880
Where is Keen?

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.000
The man who's

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.160
tall, fair-skinned, and looks

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.840
cute.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.400
Over there?

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280
Thank you.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.480
You know,

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.920
it's Klao, who's a reporter.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.800
I'm following her page.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.520
She's cute.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.480
Come here.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.480
Keen,

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.480
you suddenly called and told me that
you faced a debt-collecting gang.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.600
And what is this?

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.880
You ran and hid here at a boxing camp.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.760
Uh-oh, what a mess.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.400
I'm sorry, Sis.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.800
It's somewhat urgent.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.040
I need your help with something.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.000
I know you are experienced in sports industry.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.000
What is it?

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.680
Do you know this person?

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.000
It's Pakorn,

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.760
a boxing camp promoter

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.920
and also the owner
of the P. White Tiger Boxing Camp.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.240
Why?

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.560
Can you take me to him?

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.560
I'd like to ask for his help.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.000
Are you crazy?

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.760
What do you want him to help with?

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.200
No, no.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.480
Why would he help you?

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.880
The boxer fee or the purse
in this camp isn't very high.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.960
Only Thun purse is THB 200,000,
excluding prize money.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:26.800
And

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.880
how much is the usual prize money?

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.320
It depends on each match.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.280
In the latest match, he won
and got THB 300,000.

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.480
Split half and half with the camp.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:37.720
Why?

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.720
Are you trying to find matches for Thun?

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.400
What if I can do it?

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.080
Can I get a piece in percentage?

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:50.800
How much?

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.080
30.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.120
Too much.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.880
It's more than half of what the camp gets.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.000
I think 10.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.920
That's just right.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.440
So, if the first match I get is for Thun,

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.120
can I get 20?

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.440
If you don't just talk the talk,

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.440
I'll give you the 20 as you asked for.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.000
Deal.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.480
I got it.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.760
I didn’t think it will be this coincidence.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.120
because I'm about to have
an interview with him.

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.120
- You can secretly tag along.
- Can I?

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.720
But, don't tell anyone
that I told you about this.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.920
Thank you, Sis.

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.200
What are you gonna do?

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.240
I just want to get out from this shitty life.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.440
This means the success
of the P. White Tiger Camp

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.360
didn't gain easily at all, right?

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.440
Nothing comes easy.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.680
I'm a boxer.

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.640
Victory comes with scars.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.200
Everything comes with a price we must pay.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.320
Keen,

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.880
I'd better go back. I don't want
to mess with Pakorn.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.680
Would you like to promote
any boxing program lately?

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.800
The Roaring Tiger Fight will have
a special program this Friday.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.800
The main event boxer
will fight against Typhoon

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.200
from my own boxing camp.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.280
Currently, I'm looking
for a fair-match fighter.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.240
I guarantee it will be fun.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.440
This is very exciting.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.880
Anyway, I want to sincerely
thank you, Mr. Pakorn,

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.600
for the honor of having you on our show.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:50.920
See you next time.

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.800
That's all for today. Goodbye.

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.720
Cut.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.320
Thank you very much.

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.520
Um, Mr. Pakorn.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.520
Are you in a hurry? Because

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.520
I would like to have
a moment of your time.

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.960
Someone wants to talk to you.

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.240
Come now.

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.440
Hurry up.

00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.840
This is

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.240
Keen, my junior.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.080
Hello.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.800
I'm Keen from the Petchsak Boxing Camp.

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.080
Please schedule our appointment later.
I'm in a hurry today.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.280
Hello.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:40.640
Win.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:41.840
How are you, Win?

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.440
Is your dad doing well?

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.480
Yes.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.360
Could you please listen to what he says?

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.120
Well,

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.960
I have a boxer that I think
you might be interested in.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.560
If we are to discuss this,
let's schedule it for another day, Win.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.400
I would like to let Tiger Taming Cannon

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.440
have a battle with Typhoon Roaring Sky.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.800
Well,

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.320
if we present a story that

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.440
Thun and Typhoon were best friends
in the same camp before,

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.520
and they both had a quarrel,

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.160
falling out, then having to
get back in the same ring,

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.000
I think people would want to watch it.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:39.800
It's like

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.480
best friend turned enemy.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.240
That's true.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.160
That's a good idea.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.160
The ratings will definitely go up.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.200
Best friend turned enemy?

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.280
So, your dad agreed, right, Win?

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:02.840
Yes.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.880
Alright, I agree.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.200
Then, I'll add a hundred thousand
to Thun's purse.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.480
But you can't change your mind.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.400
Okay?

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.520
Yes.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.480
Good.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.440
Did you ask Thun?

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.120
- Don't tell me...
- I'll handle it.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.240
What's up?

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.440
I need to talk to you.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.080
- Wait until you're done.
- Hold on.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.960
Can you help me in the shower?

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.080
It stings if the wound gets wet.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.280
You can still use your hand.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.640
I know.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.040
But I want you your hand.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.680
How's training going?

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.760
Just normal training.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.000
And

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.720
if it's a pre-fight training,

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.880
is it like a regular training?

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.400
Well,

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.520
regular training,

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.040
but with a bit of weight control.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.000
Why are you asking about training?

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.440
I found a match for you.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.360
When?

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:07.920
Next month.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.200
With whom?

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440
I came to collect your father's debt.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.320
Petchsak.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.840
Didn't that boxing camp make
a lot of money from The Cannon?

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.920
So, if the first match I get is for Thun,

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.680
can I get 20?

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.240
Deal.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.640
Best friend turned enemy?

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.240
Then, I'll add a hundred thousand
to Thun's purse.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.840
Did you ask Thun?

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.560
- Don't tell me...
- I'll handle it.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.080
With Typhoon.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.280
In this camp, you're the one
with the highest earnings.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.360
I'm doing this for the camp,
and also for you.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.600
If it's him,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:45.720
I won't fight.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.320
Why...?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.640
Do you really not want to fight me that much...?

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.520
How long are you gonna look down on me?

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.280
You’ve never changed,

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.760
Listen to me first, alright?

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.840
If you agree to fight...

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.840
Just stop talking.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.480
I'm gonna fight with Typhoon.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.920
Tonight's Battle of Roaring Tigers

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.120
must be exciting and crazy.
