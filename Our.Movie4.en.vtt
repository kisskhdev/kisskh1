OUR MOVIE

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.258
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.510
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.761
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.145
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.165
Jeez, tell me about it.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.799
Sir, I think you should speak to her.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.009
How's it looking? Is she okay?

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:52.844
No, she's going all like this.

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.876
Let's keep it calm.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.549
You say "cut" when I cry,

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.553
when I smile, when I look blank,
when I look nervous. You keep saying no.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.557
Why don't you just say what you want?

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:43.895
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.982
For six months,
I've been getting love letters

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.484
from the guy
who's been cleaning this place.

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:52.654
I've never even seen his face,
but now I'm in love with him?

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.323
How am I supposed to believe that?

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.616
That's just totally creepy!

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.162
How am I supposed to act like I'm in love?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.789
You're right.

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:09.629
That's true.
A person wouldn't fall in love like that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.591
when you've never seen him.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.301
What kind of…

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:16.720
What kind of director says that?

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.647
This is a secret, but I'm making this film
because I don't really know.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:29.816
Don't know what?

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:33.779
What it's like to love someone.

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:45.082
Let's go.

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:52.964
I'm ready now.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.886
I think I understand the feeling.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:41.638
EMMA

00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:01.116
EPISODE 4

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.245
Jungwoo's running a bit late.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:06.955
So is Daeum.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.084
Ms. Go's already making moves.

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.377
She pulled Daeum for a chat.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.838
Probably about signing her.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.467
Who wouldn't want a star rookie like that?

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.803
Daeum doesn't need representation.

00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.973
How could a rookie
not need representation?

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.559
If I wanted an agency involved,

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.228
I wouldn't have cast a rookie.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.981
But this isn't going to be her last film.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.568
An agency like ours
could really help her take off.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.782
Don't you want to know how I've been?

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.244
It's all shoptalk with you.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.538
I hoped you were doing well.

00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:51.500
That's it?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.585
Yes, that's it.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:58.590
That kind of hurts.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.343
Yes, I actually feel hurt.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.554
I guess I can still feel hurt
when it comes to you.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.808
We're not in a place where
we tell each other everything anymore.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.771
I was hoping you'd ask me

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.315
how my marriage was,

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.609
after the way we ended.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.779
But all you can say is
you hoped I was well?

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.281
You're like a grease stain

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.326
that I can't scrub off
from the bottom of my heart.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.248
Let's talk later.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.001
What about you?

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.097
Am I still at the bottom of your heart?

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.233
What are you doing?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.154
I found many great replacements,
but they're never enough.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:06.658
I had to know if going back
to the original would finally satisfy me.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.713
Let's just focus on our movie.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.594
That's all there is between us now.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.441
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.712
Excuse me. You're Lee Daeum, right?

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.006
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.674
Nice to meet you.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:05.759
Yes.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.929
Where are you heading?
We have matters to attend to.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:11.014
Ah.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.601
Let's go upstairs.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.314
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.280
Ah.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.075
I see you've come together.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.660
Hello, Ms. Chae.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:32.994
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.455
Mr. Lee said something came up.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.416
Sorry, but we'll have to do this
another time.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.628
Why are you apologizing
when he's the one who left?

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.257
Daeum?

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.635
Yes, another time.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:49.844
Yes, another time.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:51.805
We'll talk later too, Jungwoo.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.849
Take care.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.779
Mr. Lee? This is Daeum.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.989
I have something to tell you.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:11.866
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:19.833
Mr. Lee.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.962
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.537
What did you want to talk about?

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.802
Sorry about canceling last minute.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.513
Something just… came up.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.599
Something important enough
to blow off three people?

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.311
I had an important meeting here.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.689
Oh.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:43.773
I see.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.527
So, what did you want to talk about?

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:50.739
Oh.

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:52.741
TIME TO EAT

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.370
I'm hungry. How about we eat first?

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.456
That again. What is it?

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.625
- Pardon?
- That alarm. What's it for?

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.420
Why set one just to eat?
It's not like it's meds.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.506
Food is just as important as meds for me.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.134
Uh…

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.347
To put it simply,
I heard that if I skip a meal,

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.058
I could die.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.728
What does that mean?

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:23.563
The thing is…

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:27.067
My body can't absorb nutrients
like most people's,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.445
so I need to eat a lot, often,
and at regular times

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.030
to get more nutrients.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.950
If I go too long without food,
I could go into shock,

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.411
or if it's bad enough, I could die.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.175
Can you get us something to eat, Junbyung?

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:45.794
Okay.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.170
KIM JUNGWOO

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.173
MISSED CALL: KIM JUNGWOO
MISSED CALL: KIM JUNGWOO

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.143
Why are we at the playground?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.195
I don't think that'll help your digestion.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.571
Hmm?

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.035
Something you want to say?

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:26.876
Well.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:32.006
I really hope you don't get angry
with what I'm about to say,

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.845
but it was my fault, so I totally
understand if you do.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.014
It's okay, just tell me.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.154
I went to Seoyoung's rehearsal studio
and had a seizure,

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.489
so she kept people from seeing me

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.366
and took me to the hospital.

00:10:58.449 --> 00:10:59.534
I'm sorry!

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.036
Seizure? You had a seizure?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.497
- Yes.
- Are you all right now?

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.582
Look at me.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.802
You seem all right.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:24.559
Of course, I am!
That's why I went through the test shoot…

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.817
And all, yes.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.321
As long as you're okay.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:41.910
What?

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.246
Are you surprised I didn't yell at you?

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.581
Feeling relieved now?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.629
You just broke the first clause
of our confidentiality agreement.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:58.176
Actually, Seoyoung doesn't know
what my condition is or how serious it is.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:01.346
So I didn't exactly break the rule

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:05.850
I'm really sorry.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.145
Thanks for being honest with me.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.984
You should always ask for help
in that kind of situation.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.946
It's actually a good thing
Seoyoung was there.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.327
Mr. Lee.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:34.045
You launched Seoyoung's career, right?

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.970
What was she like back then?

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.598
Well…

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:52.438
She's a great actress who taught me
something I didn't know very well.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.023
Mmm.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.904
Then, what kind of person
is Seoyoung to you?

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.866
To a director, it doesn't matter
what kind of person an actor is.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.332
But you're working together.
How can that not matter?

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.503
I mean, who they are as an actor matters
more than who they are as a person.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.342
You make things sound so complicated.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.182
To me, though,

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.853
you're a good person.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:33.771
I'm not sure about that.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.942
I'm very good at reading people.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:39.777
Trust me.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.949
Her name is Lee Daeum.
It's still under embargo.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.744
We get promo material
for a rookie actress,

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.788
and you get Chae Seoyoung and Kim Jungwoo.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.790
You can't deny that's an amazing deal.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.835
Okay. I'll call you back.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.884
Why'd you bail on the actor meeting
and double my workload?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.012
I told you, something came up.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.513
What's up with you?

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:08.741
LOVE IN WHITE
PHOTO SHOOT &amp; INTERVIEW PLAN

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:09.766
A photo shoot.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.060
With the three leads.

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:20.234
Isn't this too soon?
They've barely even met.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.696
We can do it after we wrap up filming.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.824
We've got to get things done while we can.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:30.661
Who knows how much time we'll have
after the movie's done?

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:37.335
Even getting ready for the table read
is a lot for Daeum right now.

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.837
Everything's new to her.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.132
She's new for the audience, too, huh?

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.134
Don't you think
we should introduce her first?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.719
Otherwise, who's going to care?

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.596
We can't do that.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.767
Take her off all non-filming engagements.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:55.978
Director Lee.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.649
You forget I'm not exactly someone
who needs permission for this.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:00.775
In that case…

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:06.239
Could you push the schedule a little, sir?

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.994
The reason being?

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:13.871
Well…

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:18.084
You know, to work the mystery angle.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.627
Build intrigue.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.563
You said it yourself,
she's new to the audience.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.131
Keep her hidden for a bit longer.

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.677
We make people curious about who she is

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.430
then make a bombshell reveal
for a bigger impact.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:34.934
Go on.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.895
Let's not kill the hype now.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:41.899
We wait and drop a beautiful photo shoot

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.111
at the perfect moment.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.447
Bam.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:52.285
Then, the crowd will go…

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.911
Bam. They'll erupt.

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.372
Hmm. You might be onto something.

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.082
How about we add to that?

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:02.503
A photo shoot with all three leads
plus the director.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:06.048
And I decide when it'll be
the perfect time for that.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.592
Why me?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.846
I hate to say it,

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.097
but you're good-looking.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.603
Or we can just shoot it tomorrow.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.064
No, no. I think it's a fine idea.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:28.404
So we roll with the mystery angle
for Lee Daeum starting tomorrow.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.449
Okay.

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:32.533
I'm off.

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.877
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.754
- Take care.
- Thanks.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.385
Oh, I like this headline.

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.012
- The one below that too.
- Okay.

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:56.098
We should plaster
some question marks there.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:59.060
You know how people
read quickly on their phones nowadays?

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.783
How could they write something like this?

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.105
Why? It's not like they're wrong.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.607
The headline's pretty good.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.025
Aren't you angry?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.527
It's not worth getting angry over.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.325
Daeum's going to be the lead
instead of Chae Seoyoung.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.494
She's the lead! The lead!

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:19.163
She's supposed to keep a low profile
so her face stays hidden.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.248
Okay.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:25.044
Hey, you can't post
Daeum's photos online, okay?

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:29.138
ROOKIE SENSATION LEE DAEUM
OUSTS CHAE SEOYOUNG

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.512
Jeez, this is a huge honor for our family.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.681
I'm not from this family, though.

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:42.562
ROOKIE SENSATION LEE DAEUM
OUSTS CHAE SEOYOUNG

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:01.998
Overly experimental.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:04.458
Who asked you for a review?

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:09.088
Why are you always trying
to invent new dishes?

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.675
Because this is my restaurant,

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.719
and I'm the chef?

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.183
What's with the weird look?

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.102
You know…

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.229
Are you…

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.775
No, never mind.
You've got your life together now.

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:33.279
Actually, I haven't sorted out my life yet.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.489
Why? What is it?

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:37.575
Let me ask you a favor.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.705
You're asking me for a favor?

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.088
Your patient is here.

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:13.402
Dad.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.908
Dad?

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:26.040
Dad, do you know what a table read is?

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.501
It's like rehearsing.

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:33.589
It's when everyone in the movie meets up
to read through the script, act together,

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.967
and look into each other's eyes
like this. See?

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:38.636
Something like that.

00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:42.473
And it just so happens to be tomorrow!

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:45.935
So now I'm all jittery and excited
and everything.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.687
I'm seriously freaking out.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.523
So are you happy now?

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.108
Yes.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:54.443
So happy I could die.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.409
Sorry.

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.577
So you know you should be sorry.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:15.840
- I know.
- If you do know,

00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:17.967
then how could you be so reckless?

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:20.553
I'm scared, too,

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:23.389
that I'll have another seizure

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:26.350
in a room full of people
who are there to watch me.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:30.604
That I'll ruin everything
and lose myself in the process.

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:34.108
You listen to me.
I'm not letting you end up like that.

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:35.943
Do you understand?

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:38.446
- If you won't stop on your own...
- Dad…

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:40.865
You're taking your life way too lightly!

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:46.662
What kind of father would stand by
while his daughter walks off a cliff?

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:55.004
Daeum.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:57.590
Daeum.

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.720
The clinical trial
we're preparing right now

00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:05.973
is worth getting our hopes up.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.435
So if you can just
hang on a little longer…

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.479
Is that really for me, though?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.275
- Daeum.
- Yeah?

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:18.110
What if I hang on and on and on,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.656
but it fails like everything else before?

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:29.663
You know this.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:33.542
Dad

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.213
I'm dying.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.383
But you keep denying that.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:47.598
Do you know how scared and hurt I feel
every time you do?

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:06.742
Let's just do a full checkup first, okay?

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:11.914
Okay.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.073
Just as you're running out of time,

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.868
so is your dad. You know that, right?

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:52.496
Doc,

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:57.334
I asked you to smile
when you say stuff like that.

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:06.385
Right. So, the shoot will be
about three months long?

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.179
Yes.

00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:11.223
I'm upping your dose.

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.726
You might feel a bit more foggy,

00:23:14.602 --> 00:23:16.520
but it'll help you function better out there.

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:18.981
Foggy?

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.775
That's not good.

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:27.072
But seriously, how does a kid like you

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.617
end up with the lead role, just like that?

00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:37.791
You'll have to watch your own movie
in a theater, no?

00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:39.960
Whether it's a year

00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:42.129
or a month from now…

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:47.217
Hang in there and try to live
no matter what.

00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:52.431
I'll think of other plans, too.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.520
Thank you, Doc.

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:09.323
BU SEUNGWON

00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:11.951
YOU WERE RIGHT

00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:14.411
THAT OLD-SCHOOL MYSTERY ANGLE
TOTALLY STIRRED THINGS UP

00:24:14.495 --> 00:24:17.957
PEOPLE ARE DYING
TO FIND OUT WHO SHE IS

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.212
WHO IS LEE DAEUM?
THE BIRTH OF A ROOKIE

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.295
THE ENTRANCE OF A ROOKIE
WHO OUTSHONE CHAE SEOYOUNG

00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:33.722
A table read means
all the actors and crew will be there.

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.586
My baby's got to steal the show.

00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:38.394
- Can't I just do it?
- No way!

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.312
Oh, I love it.

00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:42.940
- Good!
- Good!

00:24:44.274 --> 00:24:45.484
Ta-da!

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.820
The finishing touch is the most important.

00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:52.866
- Isn't this cute?
- It's so adorable!

00:24:55.202 --> 00:24:56.996
- It's not sticky, right?
- No.

00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:58.455
It feels super smooth.

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.040
Give me that.

00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:02.251
Keep reapplying it.

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.129
You need to do it regularly
to really block UV rays.

00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:09.508
- Can I take this with me?
- Of course, you can!

00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:10.718
Hooray!

00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:13.262
Now, hold still while I do your eyebrows.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.014
Wait, I have a question.

00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:16.724
Yes, ask away, milady.

00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:20.060
Remember in high school
when you kissed someone on the roof here?

00:25:20.144 --> 00:25:22.271
Keep it down! My mom can hear us!

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:24.440
You're busted!

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.234
She's kidding!

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.529
It wasn't even a kiss, okay?
It was like lips bumping.

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:34.324
Whatever, your lips touched.
A kiss is still a kiss.

00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:36.910
What's your deal? So what?

00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:40.205
Did you do it because you wanted to?

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:44.418
Or did you just do it without knowing
what was going on?

00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:47.671
So there's no guy,
but you want to kiss someone?

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:53.677
Or wait, maybe you're feeling curious
because there is someone?

00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:54.762
Is that it, huh?

00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:58.098
- You got a guy you want to kiss?
- No, it's not like that!

00:25:58.182 --> 00:26:01.435
There's a kiss scene
in the script, that's all.

00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:03.318
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:07.024
Your first kiss is going to be for a movie?

00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:12.529
Is there something you can do before that?

00:26:12.613 --> 00:26:14.823
- See you later!
- Okay!

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:17.284
Feels like I'm sending a baby
out into the world.

00:26:17.367 --> 00:26:18.869
Oh.

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:20.662
Hello? This is Lee Daeum.

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:23.332
Hi, I've sent a gift over to your place.

00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:25.000
A gift?

00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:27.211
What did you send me?

00:26:28.212 --> 00:26:29.546
<i>Yes, it's him.</i>

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.801
He'll be working as your manager
until the movie's released.

00:26:33.884 --> 00:26:37.137
Let him drive you from now on.
And today, of course.

00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:38.305
See you later.

00:26:41.892 --> 00:26:43.102
Hello.

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.480
So you're my gift?

00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:50.210
Yes, I'm Lim Junbyung.
And I'm your gift personified.

00:26:50.234 --> 00:26:51.735
What about your restaurant?

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.780
I'm on a kind of sabbatical.

00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:56.865
I wanted to take on a new challenge.

00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:57.950
Please, get in.

00:26:59.243 --> 00:27:00.763
You can't be late for your first read.

00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:07.209
Take care out there!

00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.840
If you're thirsty,
please open the cooler next to you.

00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:14.216
Ah

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.344
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I brought everything, ma'am.

00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:19.680
You don't have to be so formal with me.

00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:22.683
Everything feels uncomfortable right now,

00:27:22.766 --> 00:27:25.102
so if you could at least
talk to me casually,

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:27.437
I think I'd feel better.

00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:30.607
Well, we can't have our superstar
feeling uncomfortable.

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.904
I wanted to ask.

00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:40.742
Is it normal for a director
to go out of his way like this

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:43.203
for an actress that
doesn't even have a manager?

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:46.248
I'm not sure. This is my first time too,

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:48.667
and Jeha's the only director I know.

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:50.919
Man, why am I so nervous?

00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:54.548
There's a calming pill in there.
Could you please pass me one?

00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:55.883
I mean, can you get me one?

00:27:55.966 --> 00:27:57.467
Oh, yes, of course.

00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:02.598
- Here you go, sir.
- Great, thank you.

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:10.063
Jeha never asks for favors,
but he did this time, ma'am.

00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:12.232
I mean, not ma'am.

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:16.528
So you're doing him a favor now?

00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:19.406
It was always my dream
to be a movie star's manager.

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.659
A movie star?

00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:25.579
I hate to break it to you,
but I'm not a movie star.

00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:27.831
But to me, Ms. Daeum,

00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:30.792
you're my first actress
and my first movie star.

00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:57.986
LOVE IN WHITE TABLE READ

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.196
LEE DAEUM, LEE JEHA

00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:04.701
- Director.
- Hello.

00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:06.662
Are we all going out to eat after this?

00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:08.830
- Good morning.
- Hi.

00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:17.381
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:19.549
How's the bookstore set looking?

00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:21.843
- We've just started building it.
- Okay.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.144
JUST EVEN BEING TOGETHER
MAKES ME HAPPY

00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:35.107
Your seat's over there, Daeum.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.608
There's a pencil case in here.

00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:39.903
I saw a lot of actors taking notes
and highlighting stuff.

00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:42.906
There's also water and some cough drops.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.617
Hello, I'm Lim Junbyung,
Lee Daeum's manager.

00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:47.703
Great to meet you.

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:50.163
Junbyung. Can we talk for a second?

00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:53.709
Who told you to be a real manager?

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:57.045
What, you want me to be a fake one?

00:29:57.129 --> 00:29:59.089
Yes, be a fake one.

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:02.926
I asked you to keep the press
and agencies away,

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.387
since everyone's curious
about this mysterious rookie,

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.889
not for you to be an actual manager.

00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:09.307
Don't worry about that.

00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:11.810
No one's laying a finger on her
as long as I'm there.

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:13.478
That's all?

00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:15.439
Man, you really need to chill.

00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:18.734
You've been a jerk since forever.

00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:22.821
That's not what I meant.

00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:25.782
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:27.200
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:31.663
I'm Lee Daeum, playing the role of Gyuwon.

00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:32.998
So you're my daughter.

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.876
I look forward to working with you.

00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:37.627
I look forward to working with you.

00:30:37.711 --> 00:30:38.837
- Hello!
- Hello.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.172
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:56.354
So it's really you.

00:30:57.981 --> 00:31:00.692
It's been a while, Jaein.
Great to see you again.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.404
You took a leave from school
and just disappeared.

00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:06.364
Now you show up like this?

00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:09.409
As the lead? Out of nowhere?

00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:13.997
It's crazy, right?

00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:15.749
I just got lucky.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.294
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:21.004
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:31:21.088 --> 00:31:22.255
You look nice today, Daeum.

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:25.342
- Hi, Jaein.
- Hello.

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:28.512
We're counting on you, Seoyoung.

00:31:28.595 --> 00:31:30.013
Who else can I count on?

00:31:30.097 --> 00:31:32.724
Certainly not Lee Jeha
or a complete rookie.

00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:36.061
- You should trust them.
- What?

00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:39.439
I do respect
that you came all the way here

00:31:39.523 --> 00:31:41.024
by not trusting anyone,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.237
but how about you trust those two
for just this movie?

00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:49.116
You should try being a producer sometime.

00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:50.992
Then you'd understand.

00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:53.078
I feel so alone.

00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.412
Me too.

00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:57.791
I feel so alone too.

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.627
Everyone's alone in this world.

00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:07.425
"Hyunsang browses through the bookstore
then pulls out a book."

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:09.302
"Hello!

00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:12.139
Is there a book you're looking for?"

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:22.649
Hyunsang is two steps in front of you,
not across the street.

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:28.196
I thought I had to speak up
so everyone in the room could hear me.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.240
Okay, let's try again.

00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:34.202
"Hello.
Is there a book you're looking for?"

00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:37.455
"Are you…."

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:39.875
Still waiting?

00:32:41.168 --> 00:32:42.794
Gyuwon.

00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:46.631
"Let's not wait anymore."

00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:50.468
I guess that kind of acting
only comes with time, huh?

00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:51.970
Who are you, anyway?

00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:53.972
- Shh.
- Oh, right.

00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:55.724
"And if I tell you?"

00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:59.019
Are you going to run up there like that

00:32:59.895 --> 00:33:01.229
to cry and beg?

00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.107
Aren't you dying soon?

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.110
"Honestly, that's low even for you."

00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:10.530
"Gyuwon impulsively slaps Junghwa.

00:33:10.614 --> 00:33:12.532
Junghwa is baffled."

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:14.409
"Never mind.

00:33:15.702 --> 00:33:17.871
You're so miserable,
it's not worth the fuss."

00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:26.880
Thank you.

00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:31.259
Let's move on to the next scene.

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:33.803
"Don't say things
you don't mean, Hyunsang."

00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:35.722
Just be honest.

00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:37.015
You're…

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:39.851
You're fed up…

00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:41.895
You're fed up… with me being sick, right?

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.814
"Y-You're fed up
with me being sick, right?"

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.235
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:50.570
It's fine, go on.

00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:54.783
"You're f-fed up
with me being sick, right?"

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.368
Then just leave!

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.995
"Get the hell out! Go!"

00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.289
Let's move on from this scene.

00:34:01.915 --> 00:34:02.999
Let's move on.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.297
Daeum?

00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:12.008
Yes, Ms. Chae?

00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:13.093
Good job today.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.845
No, I should've been better.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.055
You were fine, really.

00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:19.766
Thank you.

00:34:21.268 --> 00:34:23.103
I wanted to ask…

00:34:24.187 --> 00:34:25.188
Did you see that day?

00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:26.481
Sorry?

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:29.067
Oh.

00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:32.070
If you didn't see, never mind.

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.614
If you're pretending you didn't, thank you.

00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:36.866
If you're really curious…

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:39.411
No, I'm not curious.

00:34:40.537 --> 00:34:41.538
Ah.

00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:43.707
Great work today, Ms. Chae.

00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:55.176
Thank you for today. That was great.

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:01.725
It must've been tough writing this script.

00:35:01.808 --> 00:35:03.059
No, it was fine.

00:35:03.643 --> 00:35:04.728
How's your health?

00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.896
Are you done with chemo?

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.316
It's like I've never been sick.

00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:12.360
Funny how life works.

00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:15.113
I didn't think I'd be in this movie again.

00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:16.906
Right.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.325
I'm counting on your help.

00:35:20.243 --> 00:35:22.954
I keep thinking
about Director Lee Duyoung.

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.208
Thank you.

00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:29.753
I should be thanking you.

00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:31.504
I really wanted you to be in this.

00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:34.716
Are you…

00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.093
Really all right with this?

00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:40.013
With what?

00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:45.810
Nothing, I should get going.

00:35:46.436 --> 00:35:48.688
Okay. I'll see you on set, then.

00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:52.359
Jeha.

00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:55.278
You don't…

00:35:56.571 --> 00:36:00.325
Have to push yourself too hard, you know?

00:36:00.408 --> 00:36:02.202
Even if you just let it be,

00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:04.120
Lee Duyoung is just Lee Duyoung,

00:36:04.204 --> 00:36:06.289
and Lee Jeha is still Lee Jeha.

00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:11.002
Okay, I'm really going now.

00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:20.053
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:26.393
I was worried that my manager
was waiting for too long,

00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:28.770
so I went down
to tell him to take a break.

00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:32.440
You were great.

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:38.446
I've been practicing as much as I could,
but I was too nervous.

00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:43.743
You were entirely surrounded
by respected veteran actors in this room.

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:46.287
It'd be strange not to be nervous.

00:36:46.788 --> 00:36:48.623
Still, I messed up.

00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:50.542
Messed up or held back?

00:36:52.544 --> 00:36:55.255
- Pardon?
- That's how it looked to me.

00:36:55.797 --> 00:36:58.216
You wanted to do it so perfectly

00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:02.512
you couldn't bear to fake
even a single line

00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:03.680
from what I saw.

00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:07.142
I guess I didn't analyze
my character enough.

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:09.102
I can help you with that.

00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:14.274
We're about to fall in love, hate,
and regret each other on-screen,

00:37:14.357 --> 00:37:15.734
so let's help each other out.

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:18.027
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.571
You're still here.

00:37:21.823 --> 00:37:25.160
Uh, I thought we should
talk to each other a bit more.

00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:26.745
Ah.

00:37:27.787 --> 00:37:28.788
Please, sit.

00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:34.043
Actually,

00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:37.589
I'd prefer it if you two
didn't talk to each other too much.

00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:39.966
Well, of course.
I know your directing style.

00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:42.719
I prefer emotions that
come out naturally on set

00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:45.096
over anything too rehearsed or practiced.

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:48.558
I understand what you mean.

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:50.810
I'll get going now.

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.481
Bye, Daeum.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.484
Good night, Mr. Kim.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.962
Where do you think you're going?

00:38:18.046 --> 00:38:19.881
Sorry?

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.382
And this too.

00:38:21.466 --> 00:38:24.552
She's in shock and barely breathing.

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:26.930
She can't just shed one perfect little tear.

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:28.890
I'll have to fix this.

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:33.770
Can you try Scene 109 again?

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:39.192
"You're tired of me being sick, right?"

00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:41.402
Let me try again.

00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:44.948
"You're tired of me being sick, right?"

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:46.616
Why are you saying it like that?

00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:51.162
Why do you keep trailing off at the end?

00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:53.790
Because I don't understand.

00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:56.626
Mmm, Gyuwon's in so much pain,

00:38:56.709 --> 00:39:00.213
not because she's sick, but more so
because she can't see him anymore.

00:39:00.296 --> 00:39:02.799
But the direction says
"like it's no big deal,"

00:39:03.383 --> 00:39:04.926
and I can't understand it.

00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:09.597
Why should Gyuwon love Hyunsang?
There's no reason for her to love him.

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.808
"Like it's no big deal" is correct here.

00:39:12.392 --> 00:39:14.894
The man talked big,
like he'd always be there,

00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:16.396
but ended up betraying her.

00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:18.356
And Gyuwon is sick

00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:20.692
and all alone.

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:24.028
That doesn't feel real at all.

00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:26.698
Everything just feels cold and cruel.

00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:29.826
Didn't you say you wanted realism?

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.452
Are you sure this is realism?

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:33.288
Like I told you last time,

00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:36.666
this may look like a romance,

00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:38.469
but love is the last thing this film needs.

00:39:38.543 --> 00:39:41.296
I don't know why you'd say "need"
when it comes to love.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.299
The world isn't all hearts and roses.

00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:46.634
Hearts and roses?

00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:52.932
Some people chase the fantasy of love,
only to get stabbed in the back

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.519
and end up completely alone.

00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:21.586
Hello?

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:23.588
Yes, I forgot to say something earlier.

00:40:23.671 --> 00:40:25.256
Mr. Lee, it's 11 p.m.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.009
Don't you think it's too harsh
to tell me off this late?

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.469
I'm not going to tell you off.

00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:32.889
Just telling you to only rehearse
in our scheduled readings.

00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:35.433
<i>Don't meet anyone separately,
except Seoyoung.</i>

00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:41.230
Uh, but I have
the most scenes with Jungwoo.

00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:43.691
And what if he finds out you're sick?

00:40:44.192 --> 00:40:45.193
Oh.

00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:47.028
Okay.

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.947
Okay, then. Good night.

00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:02.460
How about Park Seungyeon
for the Steadicam?

00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:06.381
Oh, you haven't heard?

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:10.259
Seungyeon passed away two years ago.
The cancer came back.

00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:15.723
You've been hiding away
from the scene for too long.

00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:20.728
Well, important people like him
only work when it really matters.

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:24.232
Oh, of course.

00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:28.277
ANDONG - THE CENTER
OF KOREA'S SPIRITUAL CULTURE

00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:29.487
WOLYEONG-GYO BRIDGE

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.614
What a view.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:35.451
It's nice during the day, but the lighting
is on another level at night.

00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:39.455
Wow. I'll check in
with our director and get back to you.

00:41:49.215 --> 00:41:52.427
Thank goodness we found a good place
for the bookstore early.

00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:56.305
We'll be able to
build everything on schedule.

00:41:58.808 --> 00:41:59.892
Mr. Lee?

00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:04.063
Yes, I like it. It's nice.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:26.210
CINEMA JONGNO

00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:33.968
KIM JINYEO

00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:37.930
Hey, you're here.

00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:41.517
You know Ms. Kim Jinyeo quite well, right?

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.408
You have to really watch out for this one.

00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:06.292
- Who are you?
- I'm Lim Junbyung.

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:09.045
- Pardon?
- I'm Ms. Lee's manager, Lim Junbyung.

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:11.756
Ah.

00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.817
If you're family,
you shouldn't do business together.

00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:15.718
- Daeum's in there, right?
- Yes.

00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:18.846
I'm actually the CEO
of Beyond Entertainment.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.807
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

00:43:21.516 --> 00:43:23.684
Ms. Lee's resting right now.

00:43:25.394 --> 00:43:28.189
Everything here is to help with that.

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:30.566
Move if you're not going to help.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:31.651
You can't go in.

00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:37.782
- You can't. No.
- Come on! I said move!

00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:39.867
- For crying out loud!
- You can't go in.

00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:41.994
Goodness! Daeum!

00:43:42.662 --> 00:43:43.704
Hello.

00:43:43.788 --> 00:43:45.414
It's so great to see you.

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.918
Would you mind letting me in?

00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:53.673
AT THE END OF US

00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:57.009
What's all this, Ms. Go?

00:43:57.093 --> 00:43:58.719
After this movie,

00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:02.181
they're all scripts you should look at
for your next project!

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.143
As I told you last time

00:44:05.226 --> 00:44:08.771
I figured I should at least
show you what I can do.

00:44:09.272 --> 00:44:12.316
I appreciate the gesture, but I can't.

00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:17.822
I can make you the next Chae Seoyoung.

00:44:17.905 --> 00:44:22.201
No, even a bigger star than her.

00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:24.662
I already

00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:28.416
have a great manager over there, actually.

00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:30.918
Daeum!

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:37.592
It's hard out there
for an actress to survive on her own.

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:38.843
Wow, talk about clingy.

00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:39.927
That little…

00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:41.679
He means the rice cake.

00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:44.223
Yes, this honey rice cake
is really clinging to my mouth.

00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:47.810
It must've been out too long and gone bad.

00:44:47.894 --> 00:44:48.936
Why those…

00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.859
- Take care now.
- Goodbye.

00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:56.652
This book looks a little weird.

00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:59.405
Check these out. And these…

00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:03.242
There are all kinds of genres here.

00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:05.077
And all the big directors and writers.

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.206
I'm not interested.

00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:11.459
Not even a little?

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.645
Even if I were, I couldn't do any of it.

00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:18.132
Right. I'm sorry.

00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.886
I got ahead of myself.

00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:28.434
I'm going to head out for a bit.

00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:29.560
Where to?

00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:33.231
There's someone I really want to meet.

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.906
I'm sorry for showing up like this.

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.621
About <i>Love in White</i>…

00:45:49.664 --> 00:45:51.374
My father didn't write it, did he?

00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:55.169
You knew, didn't you?

00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:57.838
Why don't you take a seat?

00:45:57.922 --> 00:45:59.298
Why tell me this now

00:46:00.967 --> 00:46:02.468
after all this time?

00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:04.804
Hold on.

00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:09.433
- Gosh.
- I'm so sorry.

00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:11.185
- Come here.
- No, I'm fine.

00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:15.231
I have a first aid kit somewhere.

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:23.406
She was the lead in the original,

00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:26.909
so I just came by to meet her, that's all.

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.664
Mr. Lee.

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:34.625
Mr. Lee.

00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:36.335
Let go.

00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:44.760
Why are you here?

00:46:44.844 --> 00:46:46.387
Why are you being like this?

00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:49.432
Why are you so rude to Ms. Kim?

00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:51.475
You heard everything.

00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:56.647
You said you looked me up.

00:46:58.232 --> 00:47:00.609
All the information you need
would've been there.

00:47:04.697 --> 00:47:06.282
Why were you even eavesdropping?

00:47:06.365 --> 00:47:07.867
I wasn't trying to!

00:47:08.617 --> 00:47:09.869
I couldn't help overhearing it.

00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:16.647
Are you leaving without apologizing?

00:47:19.253 --> 00:47:21.297
More like I'm leaving
without getting an apology.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:32.641
Daeum!

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.191
Don't go in there.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.445
I left in such a rush.
I should at least say goodbye.

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:48.199
Sorry to put you in an awkward spot,
but I don't want you to go back in there.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.864
This is driving me insane.

00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:31.242
I

00:48:32.952 --> 00:48:35.496
I don't even know what I heard back there…

00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:40.167
So please don't go insane over it.

00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:46.966
Since I know your secret,
could you keep one of mine?

00:48:51.637 --> 00:48:53.097
Your secret?

00:48:54.306 --> 00:48:56.767
Everyone thinks
Lee Duyoung wrote <i>Love in White</i>…

00:49:01.522 --> 00:49:03.190
But I don't think he wrote it.

00:49:04.817 --> 00:49:06.485
What?

00:49:10.072 --> 00:49:13.617
I don't even know what I'm feeling.
Ashamed, foolish…

00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:18.789
That's why I'm making this film.

00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:21.917
To return <i>Love in White</i>
to its real writer…

00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:25.337
In a way that…

00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:30.050
As many people as possible
will know the truth.

00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:41.520
PAINKILLER

00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:52.990
Our brains

00:49:53.616 --> 00:49:54.909
can't tell the difference…

00:49:57.244 --> 00:49:59.413
Between emotional pain and physical pain.

00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:03.959
So please take this today, okay?

00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:08.422
Good night.

00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:11.425
Ah…

00:50:13.135 --> 00:50:15.262
You should take this with warm water.

00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:17.306
And…

00:50:18.724 --> 00:50:21.560
You need to sleep well, okay?

00:50:21.644 --> 00:50:22.811
Got it?

00:50:25.314 --> 00:50:26.315
Promise?

00:50:26.398 --> 00:50:27.399
Hmm?

00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:29.068
Okay.

00:51:05.187 --> 00:51:06.981

FOR LOVE IN WHITE

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.149
What's this?

00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:11.277
That spot looked great.

00:51:11.944 --> 00:51:13.946
They're even offering funding too.

00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:15.322
WOLYEONG-GYO BRIDGE

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.283
I don't think we're low on budget.

00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:19.743
We're always low on budget, man.

00:51:20.369 --> 00:51:23.205
Good spot or not,
I don't want to add unnecessary travel.

00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:25.695
It'll just stretch the schedule.

00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:29.044
That's strange.

00:51:29.587 --> 00:51:32.506
Extra shoot days are my problem,
as the producer.

00:51:33.674 --> 00:51:34.883
Anyway, fine.

00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:36.343
Nice weather we have today.

00:51:36.427 --> 00:51:39.221
Now, let us proceed with a bow

00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:42.182
to the spirits of heaven and earth,

00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:45.227
praying for the safe shoot
as well as the health and well-being

00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:47.104
of our cast and crew.

00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:48.707
We'd like to invite Mr. Kim Hyuncheol,

00:51:48.731 --> 00:51:50.858
who was a part of
this movie's original history.

00:52:09.084 --> 00:52:10.502
LOVE IN WHITE

00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:17.134
Closer together, please!

00:52:20.012 --> 00:52:22.222
Get ready. One, two, three.

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.311
You don't have to see me out.

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:28.479
- Go back in.
- Goodbye.

00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:29.730
Keep it up!

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.902
Don't you think this is cute?

00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:38.072
Isn't this pig just too cute?

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:40.532
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's so cute.

00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:42.743
- We can't have it hurting people.
- Is it over?

00:52:44.953 --> 00:52:47.164
I think it's over. Right?

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:50.334
- I brought it here yesterday.
- Really?

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:51.752
I prepared everything.

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.629
- Wow.
- How did you manage that?

00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:56.048
- It was nothing.
- No way.

00:52:57.091 --> 00:52:58.611
Were you two able to greet the others?

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:08.519
- We're eating pork today.
- Isn't that a bit cruel?

00:53:13.816 --> 00:53:16.443
You canceled last time,
so it's on you to reschedule.

00:53:16.527 --> 00:53:19.780
- We'll be seeing each other a lot, so…
- Why not today?

00:53:20.823 --> 00:53:22.491
It's a chance to make it up to us.

00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:29.373
Mr. Lee doesn't drink.

00:53:32.793 --> 00:53:35.045
That's rare for a director.

00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:40.467
He said that in our last film together,
don't you remember?

00:53:41.093 --> 00:53:44.221
I was too scared
to even go near him back then.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.016
Daeum doesn't drink either.

00:53:52.104 --> 00:53:53.147
Ah.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.108
I noticed you two seem pretty close.

00:53:58.485 --> 00:54:00.571
Like you know each other very well.

00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:01.947
- No...
- We are close.

00:54:03.866 --> 00:54:08.078
He cast me when I was a total nobody,
so I've been trying hard to get close.

00:54:08.162 --> 00:54:09.455
Rookie energy and all!

00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:11.290
Okay. Cheers.

00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:14.877
Mr. Lee.

00:54:15.544 --> 00:54:17.337
Don't you think
Gyuwon's story is too tragic?

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:19.673
She's young and beautiful

00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:23.469
but has to die
after losing the man she loves.

00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:32.311
Everyone dies eventually.

00:54:34.062 --> 00:54:37.900
I don't think it's such a tragedy if
you live the life you have meaningfully.

00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:41.278
Even the love we think will last forever…

00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:44.781
Eventually fades, doesn't it?

00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:51.997
Got any other wine? This one's too dry.

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.376
I don't know.
Someone drank all the sweet ones recently.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.560
Are you sure you don't want some, Daeum?

00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:02.174
I'm fine. Just this is enough.

00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:11.934
Are you sick or something?

00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:15.187
Sorry?

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:16.313
I was just wondering.

00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:19.191
One glass should be fine, no?

00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:25.113
Daeum, have you seen the original film?

00:55:25.697 --> 00:55:26.698
Of course.

00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:28.992
I cry every single time I watch it.

00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:31.537
Oh. Hey, you're just like me.

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.705
So do I. It gets me every time.

00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:35.165
You two seem to click.

00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:38.043
Mr. Lee, how do they look in a two-shot?

00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:42.339
They look good together.

00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:49.555
Seoyoung and I…

00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:54.059
We're actually seeing each other.

00:55:56.812 --> 00:55:58.272
Oh.

00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:01.108
Wow!

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.568
Congratulations.

00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.611
Yes, that's something to celebrate.

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:08.073
It's stuffy in here, I need some fresh air.

00:56:09.074 --> 00:56:10.617
The terrace is over there.

00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:32.472
Well, that killed the mood fast.

00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:42.274
When did it start?

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.484
Right after the divorce.

00:56:45.277 --> 00:56:47.613
Why are you asking if Daeum is sick?

00:56:49.531 --> 00:56:52.451
I just thought it was odd for someone
her age not to drink a single drop.

00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:56.496
It's even weirder if you think
I had some ulterior motive asking that.

00:56:58.332 --> 00:57:00.876
- I heard you took her to the hospital.
- Yeah.

00:57:03.462 --> 00:57:04.880
I didn't think she'd tell you.

00:57:05.797 --> 00:57:07.132
That's surprising.

00:57:08.216 --> 00:57:09.968
I guess she tells you everything.

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.941
She said she wasn't feeling well that day.

00:57:13.013 --> 00:57:14.556
She's a bit anemic too.

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.433
Just…

00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:18.894
Nothing you need to worry about.

00:57:22.356 --> 00:57:23.815
You really care about Daeum, huh?

00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:26.568
I just need her.

00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:28.320
That's all.

00:57:37.204 --> 00:57:38.455
Have a good night.

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:08.026
Mr. Lee.

00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:09.861
Yes?

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.282
You know…

00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:18.328
Is it possible

00:58:19.204 --> 00:58:20.914
to kiss someone…

00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:23.959
When you don't love them?

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:27.212
Or rather, when you're not even sure…

00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:31.049
If what you're feeling

00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:33.677
is love?

00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:41.017
That's what Hyunsang does to Gyuwon.

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:42.728
Oh.

00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:47.441
Write down whatever you don't get.
I'll explain it to you later.

00:58:47.983 --> 00:58:49.443
It's a good question.

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:52.863
You should use me, mmm,

00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:54.489
as much as you need like this.

00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:56.116
Wow.

00:58:58.285 --> 00:58:59.286
Mmm.

00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:03.248
What?

00:59:03.957 --> 00:59:05.917
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:08.503
Have a good night.

00:59:11.173 --> 00:59:12.174
Okay.

00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:42.287
Why didn't you just punch Jeha?

00:59:43.205 --> 00:59:45.665
It's pouring outside. Stay the night.

00:59:47.626 --> 00:59:49.127
Why not invite the press, too?

00:59:49.795 --> 00:59:51.004
Saying that to your costar

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:53.673
and the director we're stuck with
for the next three months?

00:59:54.716 --> 00:59:56.134
Do you have any common sense?

00:59:56.927 --> 00:59:57.928
Or basic decency?

00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.639
They were going to find out anyway.
No big deal. Work's work.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:03.099
It's a big deal because
it interferes with my work!

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.268
You keep looking at him.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:14.528
That's why I said it.
I wanted you to know I was upset.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.699
I thought we were done talking about that
when I joined this movie.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:22.744
I guess not.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.205
I wasn't.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:28.959
I'm sorry.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:31.294
This won't happen again.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.840
<i>Ding-dong!</i>

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.093
Stay there, I'll head down.

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:25.765
Daeum.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:29.936
How did you know I lived here?

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.772
Your friend is my manager after all.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.524
Did you forget?

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:36.985
Are you okay?

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.529
Want to step outside?

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.781
Just for a moment.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:43.909
Are you out of your mind?

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.953
Don't you know what'll happen
if you catch a cold?

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:50.665
I'll be fine if I shower right away!

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:55.503
This feels amazing!

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.214
Why do you keep going out in the rain?

01:01:58.798 --> 01:01:59.799
Stop it.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:05.221
I figured

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.516
you'd never join me…

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.437
But you really are uptight.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:16.608
This feels so good, though.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.530
Did you walk from home in the rain?

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.993
No. I had an umbrella, too.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:30.455
I was only in the rain
for about 10 seconds.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:35.710
What, you think I've been out here
soaking wet for an hour?

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.423
Let's go. I'll take you home.

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.556
So this is what it felt like.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.894
My mom showed me

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.563
how to play in the rain

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.192
when I was terrified,
like you are right now.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.781
What a low blow, bringing up your mom.

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:10.495
You're like a person made of concrete.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:16.209
Let's forget all the pressure
for just a minute.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.337
Just one minute.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:20.797
Trust me.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:23.383
It really does feel amazing.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:27.762
It better be.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.045
One minute's up.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:46.382
That was too short.

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:48.885
Such a shame.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:53.056
You really counted to the second, huh?

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:02.482
You know what? It just feels too unfair.

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:04.859
Scene 30.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:08.029
"The two share a soft kiss."

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:29.926
You told me to use you.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.797
That's it. Daeum's not leaving
the hospital anymore. Got it?

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.301
Wow, Ms. Go.
You're full of energy this morning...

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:55.261
Help me sign Lee Daeum.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.806
<i>It's better for you not to sign Daeum.</i>

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.141
Who are you?

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:01.684
<i>What exactly is wrong with Daeum?</i>

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.662
CAN YOU LEAVE ME SOME TIME?
I WANT TO CHOOSE MY OWN ENDING.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.606
<i>I honestly don't know how to do that.</i>

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.025
<i>I understand how my dad feels,</i>
