00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:11.947
Help…

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.784
So people shouldn't be treated
as a means to an end.

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.911
-Why?
-What?

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.370
What do you mean, "Why?"

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:21.040
What aren't you getting about
not treating humans as a means to an end?

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:23.334
Sir. I'll go and get Jin-ung.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.627
-Where…
-Hey.

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.383
Sir. I'll go help her out.

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:33.093
Why would you…

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:34.220
Hey.

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:37.473
-I'll bring them all back.
-What?

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:39.016
What was that?

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.352
Your group's really tight.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.271
-But Jin-ung's in our group.
-But Jin-ung's in our group.

00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:47.107
Those little punks!

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.322
Seong-A. Wait up.

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:55.491
They're so darn fast.

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.126
Wait.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.462
I don't feel good about this.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.550
-What's wrong?
-This path leads to the abandoned house.

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.052
Does it?

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.180
Then I'll go alone from here.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:20.683
You have to be careful until tomorrow.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.686
Here.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.646
-What?
-I promised.

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.191
I saw Seong-A cry.

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.320
Like hell she would.

00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:34.822
Seong-A never cries.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:40.494
And I think she cried because of me.

00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.249
Do you think she'll ever forgive me?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.626
She was bawling.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.044
Did she really cry?

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:51.922
Did you actually make her cry?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.886
I'm like 99% sure it was because of me.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.554
You jerk. Die, punk.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.264
-Just die.
-Don't…

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.725
Oh, wait, no. You shouldn't die.

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:04.727
Don't die.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:07.563
Darn it. You little…

00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:11.317
Stop it already.
I won't make her cry again, okay?

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:14.445
I won't make her cry ever again.

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:18.032
I promise.

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:29.835
Hey, Jin-ung, breathe.

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.170
Jin-ung!

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:34.173
Release him already!

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:37.927
Kim Jin-ung. Hey, Kim Jin-ung!

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.136
Seong-A!

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.971
Why won't these doors open?

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.348
Seong-A!

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.019
Hey, let's use that rock.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.569
The heck? It's dead heavy.

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.572
Hey, wait.

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:06.956
-Hey.
-Seong-A!

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.250
Darn it. Gyeon-U!

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.544
-Are you okay?
-Why are you…

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:13.671
What's the matter with you?

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.297
Hey, what's wrong?

00:04:16.632 --> 00:04:17.549
What's happening?

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:19.885
Why are you here? It's dangerous in here.

00:04:20.386 --> 00:04:22.680
-Get out, quick.
-You want me to leave without you?

00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:24.932
I'm not such a selfish jerk.

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:29.395
And I had to come in
because you weren't safe.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.563
I can only be safe if you're safe.

00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:32.690
See? I'm fine.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.108
Let's leave together.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.193
Get the doors for me.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.111
Let's get out quick.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:49.748
This can't be…

00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:51.250
Seong-A, the doors.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.294
You really crossed the line.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.215
Why the heck would she go inside?

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.509
I might die saving her spirit-daughter.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.767
Give me that. That's what I'm here for.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:12.730
-General…
-Let's hurry.

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:16.942
A person

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.821
shouldn't do this to another person.

00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:23.949
I chose

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.453
the last offering for you myself.

00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.458
The boy absorbed
his family's misfortune for ten years.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.294
Eat him up whole

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.380
and be born again

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:40.924
as a great evil deity.

00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:46.388
Why is it Gyeon-U again?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.933
Because he's easy prey.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.020
He has no one by his side.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.064
Why would you go this far?

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.316
Just why?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.151
Weaklings

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.236
are always the prime target.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.798
Gyeon-U!

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.932
Pick a card while thinking of the one
you're to meet in the near future.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.857
It's the Devil card.

00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:41.985
They're like the Devil,
charming but also dangerous--

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.822
I'll think of the near future

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.573
and pick one more card.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.501
"Death."

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.002
The loss of life.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:03.465
The Death card
doesn't just mean one's passing.

00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:05.676
An end is always followed
by a new beginning.

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:10.097
Death means rebirth, a new beginning,

00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:13.183
and the time for a closure.

00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:15.352
Finally,

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.480
he's coming.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.487
Meet the devil and reach death…

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:28.699
You're pretty good.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.202
I'm sure your business will thrive.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:55.976
The evil spirit?

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.379
Hello, Shaman.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.468
Get out of Gyeon-U's body.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.931
Hello.

00:08:34.598 --> 00:08:36.225
Leave Gyeon-U's body right now.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.731
Get out now!

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:44.650
Darn it.

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.404
If I'm to get out,
I'd have to kill this body…

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:51.531
or you.

00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:52.616
No!

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.410
Shut up.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.291
Why are you so reckless?

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:02.668
You're a shaman.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.295
Then you must know who I am.

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:06.463
Right?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.267
Come on, don't be like this.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.561
Shouldn't you say hello back?

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:23.313
Go on.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.169
Run.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.720
What was that just now?

00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:57.681
Come here.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.565
-Leave. Get out of here, quick.
-What?

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.900
What the heck? Darn it.

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:09.985
Hey!

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.655
Don't try anything funny,
or I'll kill him!

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:14.948
No! Don't kill him.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.452
I didn't try anything.

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:21.455
I think you're the one who did.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.123
Like hell I did.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.083
Explain what happened just now!

00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:27.294
Run.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.838
Go on. Get out of here.

00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:36.011
That's not fair at all.

00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:39.056
You think you can do whatever
because you're pretty?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.975
Let's see…

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.647
How about we make a bet?

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.610
Shamans don't wager with ghosts.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.904
The person who offered
this body to me is on the way.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.407
If you catch me before she does,

00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:58.784
I'll grant you a wish.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.874
Any wish?

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.752
Yes, any wish. Whatever you want.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.003
I'll do it.

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:11.755
Okay. Then…

00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:15.342
Close your eyes and count to ten.
You've played hide and seek before, no?

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.010
Ready, go.

00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.388
One, two…

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.848
Oh, and I hope you win.

00:11:21.932 --> 00:11:23.683
I like you more than her, you see.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.229
-Here goes.
-Three.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:31.817
Four.

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.111
Five.

00:11:35.654 --> 00:11:36.988
Six.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.783
Seven.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.703
Eight.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.539
What happened? Are you all right?

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.541
Hey! Don't come in here.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.750
Wait outside.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:51.628
Nine.

00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:56.341
Ten.

00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:21.324
The thing that went by.
That's it, isn't it?

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.370
You two go ahead. I'll go after him.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:30.917
-Let's go.
-Keep going.

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:39.468
Ma'am.

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:43.305
He's been afflicted, and one got possessed
and left. Please look after him.

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.557
We saw him on the way.
The General went after him.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.267
You'll be too late
by the time you reach them.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.351
Not if I run.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.645
Fairy. Heaven and Earth Fairy.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.773
Open your eyes and see what you've done.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:57.235
Is he a fish?
Why did you pickle him with salt?

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.491
Even if you join the General,
you won't be helpful.

00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:05.243
See what you must see,
not what you want to see.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:07.996
Wake up!

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.294
BOK-I

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.046
Bok-i.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:20.675
-We pray as one…
-We pray as one…

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:24.054
The evil spirit that dwelled in the shack
harmed that young man.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.889
They refer to his state as "afflicted."

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.475
The shamans have begun
to cleanse him of it.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.852
It's dangerous,
so it's best to keep your distance.

00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:32.187
Shoo!

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:55.794
Here we go!

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.315
Why did you do this?

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:20.318
So I can live.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.280
This is all so I can live.

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:39.004
Shall I tell you
why your life is a living hell?

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.136
Don't touch me.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.310
You dare pick up the bells
in your current state?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.520
No wonder your life is hell.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:15:00.150
You're no longer a person.
You've become a den for random spirits.

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.154
Let go.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.405
Let go!

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:07.782
I don't want to.

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:17.334
Yeomhwa.

00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:30.305
Yeomhwa, you foolish thing.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.109
You poor thing.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:45.278
Great job hanging in there, handsome.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.864
Gosh, he has beautiful eyebrows.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:48.990
You'll be fine.

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:51.201
-You got lucky.
-I'm glad you're okay.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.619
But just to be safe…

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.164
Turn around.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.503
Stop making contact with Gyeon-U
as his Human Amulet.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.963
If you see him, don't go up to him.
Just call me right away.

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.382
-Why?
-I'll explain later.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.300
Go straight home
instead of looking for Gyeon-U.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.510
Why?

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:12.555
I'm swamped.
Protecting Gyeon-U is already a lot.

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.519
Are you saying I'm bothersome?

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.479
Seong-A!

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:24.984
I don't know where I'm going right now

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:29.614
-But I don't think to look around
-How do I get here?

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.035
I don't know the way
I'm stupidly clueless

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.540
I don't know
I'm clueless

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.334
I don't know the way
I'm clueless

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.086
Oh, shoot.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.379
I'm lost

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.465
I can't go where I want to go

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.676
But I don't stop walking

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.762
I look straight ahead and go

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.599
-Earlier on… I think I'm at…
-I don't know the way, I'm clueless

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.274
You're getting on my nerves.

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:06.151
Your singing's just…

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.695
Go home!

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:20.123
MO BEOM
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.797
Shall we see what's in Beom's bag?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.799
Take everything that's worth anything.

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.092
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:35.430
To think we'd meet
a friend from middle school.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.602
I'll pay you back when I can.
You know that, right?

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.776
-Jun-u, count it out.
-Okay.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:49.444
-Hey, nice wallet.
-Nice.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.696
Hey, there. Buddy.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.072
Do you know how to get here?

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:53.990
Who are you?

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.367
You must've come from here too.
Do you know how to get there?

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.327
Hey.

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.120
Didn't you hear me?

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.173
Give me that.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.801
Come on.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.222
Hey. Why did you give it to him?

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.141
Thanks for… What?

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:22.894
Come with me.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:27.857
I need to get to this place.
It's called Hwamok High School.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.360
-Do you know where it is?
-What are you saying, Gyeon-U?

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.320
I don't know the way, you see.

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:34.113
-Come on, what don't you get?
-What are you doing?

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:35.573
-Where are you going?
-Jump him already!

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:37.450
Come on, tell me the way first. Don't go.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.494
-Don't just stand there.
-Get back here!

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.419
How do I get to the school?

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.763
Hey, punk! Get back here!

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.098
Tell me where to go first.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.182
-Come here!
-What?

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:03.184
-Let go of me.
-Gyeon-U…

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.561
-What's the matter?
-Come here.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.815
CONTACTS

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:09.941
PARK SEONG-A SEONG-A

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.487
I'm swamped.
Protecting Gyeon-U is already a lot.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.119
Why you…

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.332
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:29.043
Are you a thug or what?
Why would you beat them up?

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.255
Hey. Are you with them?

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:36.676
What do you mean? I'm with you.
Partners in crime. We're friends.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:39.470
PYO JI-HO
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:44.767
"Friends"?

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.103
Yeah, we're friends.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:50.023
In fact, I'm losing my mind here
out of concern for you.

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:51.983
Where did he go?

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.495
It's not him.

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:08.082
He must be where ghosts would love to go.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.877
Somewhere dark, damp, and dank.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:13.546
Where are you?

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.840
Did something happen
in the abandoned house?

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:16.925
What?

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:19.928
She was all about us teaming up
to save you not so long ago.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:23.723
Then Seong-A said I should stay away
from you even if we met.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.559
Just what on earth happened back there?

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:31.522
Nothing happened,
but something almost did happen.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:33.316
What?

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:37.070
Wait, so the shaman told you
to stay away from me?

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.364
She must care for you a lot.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.240
Here's the thing, buddy.

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:43.743
You should do as she says for now.

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:45.411
Right now, I'm a bit…

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:47.330
dangerous.

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:50.249
What's going on?

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.210
Why have you turned into an edgelord?

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.379
What is an edgelord…

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:57.590
Whatever.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:00.802
Do you like her?

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:06.057
Good for you.
The girl you like cares for you.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.184
Hey, have you lost your mind?

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.145
I didn't tell you that I like her
just so you could tease me.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:12.897
I was putting Seong-A first--

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:15.108
You don't just like her. You love her.

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.319
Come with me, you nutcase.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.238
What do you like so much about her?

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.073
Are you into short girls?

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.308
I'll get more change. Wait right here.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.727
No, come back here.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:52.562
You want to keep playing?

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.355
Again? But you'll only get 6,000 points…

00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:57.066
You're laughing?

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.485
Don't laugh. You're freaking obnoxious.
Do you know that?

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.991
Damn it. Were you always this annoying?

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.294
What are you looking at?

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:17.378
What are you doing?

00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:19.505
Get out of my body.

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:22.425
I don't want to.

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:25.053
Didn't you see?
Even your friend couldn't tell.

00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.263
-But--
-I think I can stay.

00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:55.666
Get down!

00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:00.797
Hey, move it!

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:07.553
Move!

00:23:09.472 --> 00:23:10.598
Don't just stand there!

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:12.058
Get a hold of yourself, you idiot!

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.327
Please help!

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:32.954
I found you.

00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:19.709
I won our game of hide and seek.

00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:21.794
Now grant me my wish.

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:23.963
Please let Gyeon-U go.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.300
The thing is--

00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:29.260
You'd feel sorry for Gyeon-U too.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.639
He walked into my shrine upside-down
when we first met.

00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:36.934
People who do that
are destined to die within 21 days.

00:24:37.685 --> 00:24:40.938
He had only 3 weeks to live
when he was just 18 years old.

00:24:41.022 --> 00:24:42.732
I couldn't just let him die.

00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.025
So I've protected him.

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:47.653
"Let's get him past those 21 days
and keep him alive at all costs."

00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:51.699
Goodness.

00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:54.076
What a pitiful kid.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.536
You're wrong.

00:24:56.913 --> 00:24:58.873
That in itself isn't pitiful.
He is just unfortunate.

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:03.211
What's pitiful is that the whole world
has been hating on him

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.048
and that made him hate himself too.

00:25:08.174 --> 00:25:10.551
He doesn't love himself one bit.

00:25:12.303 --> 00:25:13.596
That is what's pitiful about him.

00:25:17.475 --> 00:25:19.310
Today's the last of the 21 days.

00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:21.562
He can live freely after today, so please.

00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:25.733
I beg of you. I need to save Gyeon-U.

00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:34.659
Why would you go to such great lengths?

00:25:37.078 --> 00:25:38.204
Because he's my first love.

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.539
Because I like Gyeon-U a lot.

00:25:45.086 --> 00:25:46.045
Please help me.

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:53.386
Seong-A.

00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:56.764
It's me right now.

00:25:57.974 --> 00:26:00.476
-I'm Gyeon-U.
-What?

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.771
I'm Bae Gyeon-U right now.

00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:12.738
What are you looking at?

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:19.161
It's me, Seong-A.

00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:22.957
What the heck are you…

00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:24.792
It's me.

00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:30.589
-Gyeon-U?
-Yes?

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:42.476
What's this?

00:26:45.438 --> 00:26:46.480
Hello.

00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:05.833
Heaven and Earth Fairy, let go.

00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:07.960
I don't think I should.

00:27:08.044 --> 00:27:10.212
He's tied up anyway. Go on.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.804
You shaman witches! Untie me this instant!

00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:21.140
I'll just kill you all!

00:27:22.433 --> 00:27:24.018
What are you? Are you a woman or not?

00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:25.644
Put your hands back on him. Quick.

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:31.942
I didn't realize Human Amulet
was this effective.

00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:34.487
He's Gyeon-U when touched,
and an evil spirit when not.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.946
The vicious evil spirit

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.616
tried to possess him
but got locked up in there instead.

00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:40.493
Even ten experienced shamans
couldn't have done it,

00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:42.953
but these two teenagers
accomplished it somehow.

00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:46.582
Don't make a fuss. He's still possessed.

00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:49.543
It isn't over until we remove the spirit.

00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:52.421
At least she found the evil spirit
and locked it up.

00:27:52.505 --> 00:27:54.465
You know that's the hardest part.

00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:56.842
Everything's ready.

00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:00.971
Let's free the afflicted kid
from the spirit.

00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:02.807
Let's begin.

00:28:06.394 --> 00:28:08.145
Gyeon-U. Stay strong.

00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:09.563
Okay.

00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:14.568
Untie me, will you?

00:28:14.652 --> 00:28:15.653
What are you…

00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:18.197
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.117
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.996
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.833
-Please hear our plea and take pity
-Please hear our plea and take pity

00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:32.002
-What are you even doing?
-All ghosts including the sinister ones…

00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:35.589
That feels so good.

00:28:35.673 --> 00:28:38.217
It's refreshing. Keep going.

00:28:41.178 --> 00:28:42.513
Where are you going?

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.224
Hey, don't toy with food.

00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:47.184
Don't do that. No. Don't.

00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:51.063
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

00:28:51.147 --> 00:28:54.483
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:58.154
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:02.116
It's tasty. Quite nutty.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.078
What are you looking at?

00:29:07.163 --> 00:29:08.914
I really hate that. Don't do that.

00:29:08.998 --> 00:29:10.499
I don't like it! Don't!

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.084
Don't you dare. I hate it.

00:29:12.168 --> 00:29:15.212
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

00:29:15.296 --> 00:29:18.674
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:21.886
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:25.347
-Please hear our plea and take pity
-It tickles. It got inside.

00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:27.016
-All ghosts…
-All ghosts…

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.853
Hey. This doesn't taste bad either.

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:32.188
What the…

00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:37.693
What's the matter?

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.028
Where are you going?

00:29:46.035 --> 00:29:48.287
-It's not working at all.
-Tell me about it.

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:50.664
We'll keep going until it works.

00:29:51.207 --> 00:29:53.459
-Get more tofu and the five grains.
-Okay.

00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:05.137
Hey.

00:30:06.764 --> 00:30:07.932
Oh, my gosh!

00:30:08.933 --> 00:30:10.059
Hey, you! Stop!

00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:11.143
-Hey.
-Get him.

00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:24.698
Seong-A.

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.997
Today's the last day.

00:30:34.375 --> 00:30:36.377
You just had to pull through one more day.

00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:40.881
I've tried so hard.

00:30:43.968 --> 00:30:45.344
It's not fair.

00:30:47.137 --> 00:30:50.849
This is just not fair at all.

00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:16.584
Right now, the best option
is to lock up the evil spirit inside you.

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.718
I'm sorry I failed to help you
make it through today.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.595
Don't be.

00:31:28.637 --> 00:31:30.973
We're getting through today just fine.

00:31:31.849 --> 00:31:33.434
Don't cry, okay?

00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:35.019
I'm sorry.

00:31:39.982 --> 00:31:41.984
I promised never to make her cry again.

00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:44.236
I made her cry yet again.

00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:49.658
I'm sorry, Seong-A.

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:53.412
I promise

00:31:53.495 --> 00:31:56.040
not to make you cry ever again.

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.083
So please stop crying.

00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:03.964
I just asked you to stop,
but you're crying even more.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.841
Don't cry.

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.177
I wish I could keep them apart.

00:32:10.763 --> 00:32:12.473
Are you all right?

00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:15.309
Sure, I'm good.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.520
I saw that done in a historical drama.

00:32:18.604 --> 00:32:20.064
Dismemberment of the limbs.

00:32:22.524 --> 00:32:24.485
We can't trust an 18-year-old boy.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.154
This is the least I can do
to ease my mind a bit.

00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:28.614
No, Mother.

00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:30.157
This is a bit too much.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.867
Be quiet and move.

00:32:34.203 --> 00:32:35.329
Hey!

00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:38.499
You old hag of a shaman.

00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:39.875
Are you going to rip me to pieces?

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:40.959
-Exactly.
-Untie me!

00:32:41.043 --> 00:32:42.294
Gyeon-U!

00:32:46.048 --> 00:32:47.508
I'm sorry. Really, I am.

00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:48.592
Why you…

00:32:50.594 --> 00:32:51.595
I'm sorry.

00:32:52.554 --> 00:32:54.181
I told you, didn't I?

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:02.147
Hey, kid.
No more than holding hands, got it?

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.066
Yes, ma'am.

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:05.484
Mother, please.

00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.903
She has a point. You're going overboard.

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:08.862
Look at their faces.

00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:11.699
He's out of her league.

00:33:12.241 --> 00:33:13.075
-Master.
-Darn you.

00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:16.203
Let's all go to bed.
It's late. Come along.

00:33:16.286 --> 00:33:17.329
Hey, 18-year-old.

00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:19.415
Hold her hand, nothing else.

00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:21.458
Stay in the boundary we set up

00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:23.627
and keep your eyes on the ceiling
like a proper gentleman.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.672
Okay. I'll remember that.

00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:29.133
Let's go. Even I'm sick of your lecturing.

00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:30.467
So sick of it, really.

00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:31.677
She's too much, right?

00:33:37.391 --> 00:33:38.684
My gosh.

00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:42.146
Mother's being dramatic, isn't she?

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.106
She's not.

00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:46.024
Think about what happened
at the abandoned shack.

00:33:46.942 --> 00:33:50.070
I totally understand
where she's coming from.

00:33:50.821 --> 00:33:52.489
That was the evil spirit, not you.

00:33:52.573 --> 00:33:55.451
As soon as you let go,
I'll become that evil spirit.

00:33:59.747 --> 00:34:02.708
But I don't regret it at all.

00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:05.919
I went in knowing it would be dangerous.

00:34:06.003 --> 00:34:08.797
And even if I had known this would happen,

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:10.549
I'd still have gone in.

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:12.384
If I hadn't been there,

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.428
you'd have become the victim.

00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.972
This is a thousand times better than that.

00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.266
That's ridiculous.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:20.726
It's not.

00:34:20.809 --> 00:34:22.644
This is exactly what you always say to me.

00:34:25.522 --> 00:34:26.607
Every archery arena

00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:29.651
has good spots and bad spots.

00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:32.029
Right now, I feel like

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:36.241
I'm standing in the worst spot
with the wind blowing in my face.

00:34:37.284 --> 00:34:38.243
It's that bad.

00:34:39.453 --> 00:34:41.205
But oddly enough, I'm not worried.

00:34:41.288 --> 00:34:42.831
I think I can beat everyone.

00:34:47.878 --> 00:34:49.171
Do you think you'll win gold?

00:34:49.797 --> 00:34:51.799
Yeah, totally.

00:34:57.054 --> 00:34:58.305
You sure are gutsy.

00:34:58.388 --> 00:35:00.265
Why did you let that thing in here?

00:35:00.808 --> 00:35:03.060
Should I have left her
on the street, then?

00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:15.155
How is she?

00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:18.367
She must've grown very weak.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.285
She still hasn't woken up.

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:24.206
Even accumulating bad karma
requires a sturdy body.

00:35:24.665 --> 00:35:28.627
She couldn't stand a touch of the sword
used to chase away petty spirits.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.046
What made her think
she could commit all those evil deeds?

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.214
Isn't it obvious?

00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.550
She was banking on the evil spirit
nesting in that shack.

00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:36.426
Ma'am.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.720
Don't you think General Dongcheon
is a bit strange today?

00:35:39.388 --> 00:35:41.598
What? I'm not sure…

00:35:42.266 --> 00:35:43.809
She's acting way too strange.

00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:46.728
The young and handsome teen
may not be the only one that's possessed.

00:35:46.812 --> 00:35:49.064
She must be possessed by something too.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.525
Why else would a powerful shaman like her

00:35:51.608 --> 00:35:54.695
keep an evil spirit and the shaman
who's served it in the same house?

00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:56.655
It could be disastrous.

00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:59.241
You're yapping away again.

00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:01.702
She's done it before.

00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:08.000
She tied my hands and feet,

00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:10.460
gagged me with a cloth,

00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:12.838
and hounded me mercilessly.

00:36:14.548 --> 00:36:16.425
She's done it before, so she's confident

00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:18.510
that she can do it again.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.891
You should have let me die then and there.

00:36:23.974 --> 00:36:26.810
Why did you let me live
knowing I'd become a problem?

00:36:28.562 --> 00:36:32.608
You're at death's door,
but you have the energy to run your mouth?

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.362
I learned from the best.

00:36:57.341 --> 00:36:59.134
This is nuts.

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.844
Why can't I fall asleep?

00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:22.134
Shoot.

00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:24.094
Where the heck did he go?

00:39:09.556 --> 00:39:10.682
I found it.

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:13.685
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:22.986
It's you, Gyeon-U.

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:24.905
Why are you here so early?

00:39:25.614 --> 00:39:26.615
What?

00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:30.452
No. I'm late.

00:39:31.912 --> 00:39:32.954
I got here too late.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.999
You little brat, talking so casually
like I'm your friend.

00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:38.335
And you're dressed like a damn clown.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.634
Just look at all this.

00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:49.513
You'd find nicer clothes
in a clothing donation drop box.

00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:51.723
You have horrible style.

00:39:53.266 --> 00:39:57.437
I know you don't have many friends,
but find someone to help you buy clothes.

00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:58.522
I could help, you know.

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:00.565
Look at you.

00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:03.068
You finally look like
a Hwamok High archer.

00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.488
Am I really on the archery team?

00:40:07.072 --> 00:40:08.657
That's not how you speak to your elder.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.034
Address me as "coach" or "sir."
Try it. "Sir."

00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:13.286
Sir.

00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:15.372
I'm on the archery team?

00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:22.045
You're rushing it.

00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:24.589
Give yourself more time.

00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:28.802
What's wrong with his posture?

00:40:30.804 --> 00:40:31.805
Darn it.

00:40:31.888 --> 00:40:33.598
What's wrong with him?

00:40:56.788 --> 00:40:58.999
Would you look at that?
My body knows what to do.

00:41:06.298 --> 00:41:07.507
Hey!

00:41:07.591 --> 00:41:08.925
I'm pretty good at archery!

00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:16.933
Yes, ma'am. I've just arrived
at Gyeon-U's house.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.144
I'll call as soon as I find him.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.984
Gyeon-U. Are you in there?

00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:33.158
Evil Spirit. Evil Spirit.

00:41:33.241 --> 00:41:35.535
Evil Spirit from the Bongsu-dong shack.

00:41:37.245 --> 00:41:38.788
I guess he didn't come here.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.795
Bok-i, I'm sorry.

00:41:46.922 --> 00:41:48.840
I need to sort this out
before I help Jin-ung.

00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:52.552
What about me?

00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:55.430
Jin-ung.

00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:01.144
Am I supposed to follow her?

00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:10.278
I heard it clearly.

00:42:11.363 --> 00:42:12.781
She said "Bok-i."

00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:23.792
It's only the morning,
but he's already annoying.

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:35.762
This is great fun.

00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:46.606
Gyeon-U.

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:50.360
Hey, Gyeon-U.

00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:52.946
Hey, partner.

00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:08.962
What do you think you're doing?
Drop the bow!

00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:17.637
Hey.

00:43:18.388 --> 00:43:20.640
I've had enough of you.
Bae Gyeon-U, come over here.

00:43:20.724 --> 00:43:22.475
-Everyone, gather around.
-Hey.

00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:24.269
-Come here.
-You're not Gyeon-U, are you?

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.814
That's right.

00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:31.609
What's going on over there? Why, you…

00:43:33.528 --> 00:43:35.071
Hey!

00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:37.490
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:39.159
It hurts.

00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.745
What is it, Bok-i? What's over here?

00:43:43.413 --> 00:43:44.664
Where? Right here?

00:43:44.748 --> 00:43:45.665
What's going on?

00:43:45.749 --> 00:43:46.958
Not here?

00:43:48.293 --> 00:43:49.294
What's wrong, Ji-ho?

00:43:50.754 --> 00:43:52.172
Gyeon-U.

00:43:52.255 --> 00:43:53.173
Gyeon-U?

00:43:53.256 --> 00:43:55.091
Gyeon-U kicked him.

00:43:55.175 --> 00:43:56.051
He kicked him hard.

00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:58.094
Gyeon-U? He was here?

00:43:58.178 --> 00:43:59.804
He just ran off. Didn't you see him?

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:01.431
Thank you.

00:44:01.514 --> 00:44:02.807
Wait. Stop.

00:44:04.893 --> 00:44:06.353
You came to school like this?

00:44:07.354 --> 00:44:08.772
In your pajamas?

00:44:22.744 --> 00:44:24.829
So you'll do
a curse-cleansing rite for me?

00:44:24.913 --> 00:44:27.749
If I don't release you
from all the layers of curse,

00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:29.459
you'll wither away and die.

00:44:30.502 --> 00:44:32.420
I can't let a person die on my watch.

00:44:34.089 --> 00:44:35.090
"A person"?

00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:38.551
Was I a person to you?

00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:42.097
If you're a ghost,
let go of your grudges and cross over.

00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.683
Human or ghost, I'll help you.
So don't complain.

00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:49.020
You. Grab the drumstick.

00:44:49.104 --> 00:44:50.021
You won't call a musician?

00:44:50.105 --> 00:44:52.357
Everyone knows each other
in this line of work.

00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:54.901
We'll keep it simple, just between us.

00:44:57.654 --> 00:44:58.696
Goodness.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.574
I'm not in the mood to play music.

00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:04.244
I'll help you.

00:45:07.122 --> 00:45:08.373
Don't worry.

00:45:16.673 --> 00:45:18.049
Darn it.

00:45:29.853 --> 00:45:30.895
What?

00:45:37.527 --> 00:45:38.570
What do you want?

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.661
No!

00:45:53.042 --> 00:45:54.461
You can't mistreat ghosts.

00:45:55.044 --> 00:45:57.464
-Why not?
-He should've moved on but couldn't.

00:45:57.964 --> 00:45:59.382
It means he has something to say.

00:45:59.466 --> 00:46:03.178
We should hear him out so he can leave
with no regrets or grudges.

00:46:07.474 --> 00:46:08.558
You're sweet.

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:10.393
But what's with the tone?

00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:15.940
I'm done being polite.
You didn't keep our hide-and-seek deal.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.901
Wait.

00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:20.904
I'm a ghost too. Won't you be nice to me?

00:46:21.905 --> 00:46:22.947
How shameless.

00:46:23.531 --> 00:46:24.908
You ran off first thing in the morning.

00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:28.786
Give me your hand so I can summon Gyeon-U.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.581
No! Don't get in my way.

00:46:31.664 --> 00:46:34.542
There's something I should do
with this body.

00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:37.545
The only thing
a student should do is study.

00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:41.174
-Cut it out and come along.
-Fine. Catch me if you can.

00:46:43.885 --> 00:46:44.886
My goodness.

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:45.970
Hey.

00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:51.017
I prefer the shaman.

00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:53.478
Why you…

00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:54.562
Get over here.

00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:58.316
Come here right now.
Don't you dare run off!

00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:09.619
Wait.

00:47:09.702 --> 00:47:10.954
Is that a lovers' spat?

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.002
Hey.

00:47:18.962 --> 00:47:20.380
-It's just a spat.
-I'll end you.

00:47:22.966 --> 00:47:24.509
It's a dogfight.

00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:30.265
Take my hand.

00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:32.308
Call it a truce.

00:47:32.392 --> 00:47:35.395
Holding hands is not a truce for me.
It's a surrender.

00:47:35.478 --> 00:47:36.479
What's a truce for you, then?

00:47:36.563 --> 00:47:38.982
Why bother with a truce?
Let's have a full-on war!

00:47:39.065 --> 00:47:40.066
You're unbelievable.

00:47:43.695 --> 00:47:44.696
Fine.

00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:46.573
Tell me your name, then.

00:47:48.157 --> 00:47:49.158
My name?

00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:52.120
-I don't have one.
-You must have a name!

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:53.204
I don't because I forgot it!

00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:54.372
Try to recall, then.

00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:56.708
I can't keep calling you Evil Spirit.

00:47:58.084 --> 00:47:59.460
Keep calling me that.

00:47:59.544 --> 00:48:01.504
Who cares what you call me?

00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:03.840
That's nonsense.

00:48:03.923 --> 00:48:06.759
If you call something an evil spirit,
they'll become evil even if they weren't.

00:48:07.343 --> 00:48:09.262
You may be an evil spirit,
but I can't call you that.

00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:11.264
I should call you by a nice name
so you become nice.

00:48:11.347 --> 00:48:14.976
Parents are super careful when they name
their babies for a reason.

00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:17.687
Wait.

00:48:18.855 --> 00:48:20.732
If you have no name, I'll give you one.

00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:23.359
After all, names are given.

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:26.821
I'll give you a name.

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:34.412
Since you used to stay
at the abandoned shack in Bongsu-dong…

00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:36.205
Bong-su. How's that?

00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:38.916
-Shouldn't you put more thought into it?
-You don't like it?

00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:41.377
Then…

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.839
Bong-su…

00:48:45.757 --> 00:48:48.051
It's a pretty neat name.

00:48:48.134 --> 00:48:50.094
Great, then. Bong-su it is.

00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:53.306
Bong-su. From now on, you're Bong-su.

00:48:54.557 --> 00:48:55.558
Whatever.

00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:59.896
-Bong-su.
-Yeah?

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.231
Bong-su. Shall we play?

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.486
-Okay.
-Bong-su. Shall we play hide and seek?

00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:09.155
I'd like that.

00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:11.699
Now then, let's play.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.496
What the heck?

00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:31.344
If you call a ghost's name three times
and the ghost replies all three times,

00:49:31.427 --> 00:49:34.681
they must submit to you
for a little while.

00:49:34.764 --> 00:49:35.973
It's a simple Summoning Spell.

00:49:36.057 --> 00:49:37.183
Darn you.

00:49:37.266 --> 00:49:38.393
Bong-su.

00:49:38.935 --> 00:49:39.894
Let's hold hands.

00:49:47.944 --> 00:49:50.321
You gave me a really hard time this time.

00:49:53.616 --> 00:49:54.992
What?

00:49:55.076 --> 00:49:56.953
We can't go home right now?

00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:00.289
They're setting up a boundary.

00:50:00.373 --> 00:50:02.125
She'll call you when she's done.

00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:03.084
But…

00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:05.253
That means

00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:08.339
I have to keep my hands on Gyeon-U
so the spirit doesn't come out.

00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.675
Lady Fairy. Good luck!

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:14.345
What's wrong?

00:50:17.223 --> 00:50:20.935
It looks like
we'll have to stay like this all day.

00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:22.937
I don't mind.

00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:26.899
What if people gossip?

00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:29.485
That's okay.

00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:32.113
People pick on everything I do anyway.

00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:34.282
No, wait.

00:50:34.824 --> 00:50:36.743
If we're holding hands,

00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:38.536
will they gossip about you too?

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.037
I wouldn't like that.

00:50:42.665 --> 00:50:45.084
Let's see. What should we do?

00:50:48.463 --> 00:50:50.131
-That's a bit awkward.
-Come this way.

00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:54.719
No, this is too weird.

00:50:54.802 --> 00:50:57.638
Behind the back like…

00:50:57.722 --> 00:50:58.639
Our hands…

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.059
What should we do?

00:51:03.728 --> 00:51:06.022
Oh, dear, Gyeon-U.
I hope you feel better soon.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:08.900
That was close.

00:51:08.983 --> 00:51:11.903
-Gosh. That was really close.
-My stomach hurts.

00:51:12.612 --> 00:51:13.613
Hey, Seong-A.

00:51:14.906 --> 00:51:16.949
Gyeon-U's sick, so I'm propping him up.

00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:18.493
We're not dating at all.

00:51:18.576 --> 00:51:20.161
How do you know Bok-i?

00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:23.206
-What?
-Bok-i, my dog.

00:51:23.873 --> 00:51:27.210
-Hey, where are your manners?
-What?

00:51:28.753 --> 00:51:31.047
-Who are you to pick on me?
-I'm not picking on you.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.174
-I'm asking nicely.
-Oh, you are?

00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:36.177
Bullshit.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.472
Guys, don't be like this.
Let's talk it out.

00:51:39.555 --> 00:51:40.848
There's a fight!

00:51:40.932 --> 00:51:42.517
Hey, they're fighting.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.684
-A fight?
-Isn't that Gyeon-U?

00:51:43.768 --> 00:51:44.894
Gyeon-U.

00:51:44.977 --> 00:51:46.896
-Why are they fighting?
-I don't know.

00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:48.356
Ji-ho!

00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:49.607
I need help.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:50.775
-Seong-A.
-Help.

00:51:50.858 --> 00:51:52.193
Help. Get rid of him now.

00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:10.044
Seong-A. Are you okay?

00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:13.381
Thanks a lot, partner.

00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:14.632
What?

00:52:16.425 --> 00:52:18.052
Hey, are you okay?

00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:21.097
Hey, stop right there!

00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:24.517
How do you know Bok-i?

00:52:28.062 --> 00:52:29.146
11TH HANRAGI ARCHERY COMPETITION

00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:39.156
I got you, you punk.

00:52:41.993 --> 00:52:43.578
It's over, guys.

00:52:48.624 --> 00:52:50.459
Your dog, the white dog.

00:52:50.543 --> 00:52:52.503
She wears a collar
with "Bok-i" engraved on the tag.

00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:55.339
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

00:52:55.423 --> 00:52:56.716
-What?
-You--

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:00.970
What? Everything's fine.

00:53:01.053 --> 00:53:02.763
Don't worry. It's all good.

00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:05.600
I'm letting this slide for her sake.

00:53:05.683 --> 00:53:07.560
If you do this again, then I'll…

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.980
-Your hand.
-What?

00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:12.106
Let go.

00:53:13.524 --> 00:53:14.358
You little…

00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:21.782
Your dog, the white dog.

00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:24.118
She wears a collar
with "Bok-i" engraved on the tag.

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:27.038
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

00:53:28.873 --> 00:53:30.124
"School."

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.919
Hwamok High School.

00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:35.254
What great courage.

00:53:35.338 --> 00:53:37.590
You're really something.

00:53:37.673 --> 00:53:38.633
NAME:
SCHOOL: HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:40.426
"Name."

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.387
What was his name?

00:53:44.597 --> 00:53:45.890
I forgot again. I keep forgetting.

00:53:45.973 --> 00:53:47.600
I can't be bothered. You fill in the rest.

00:53:47.683 --> 00:53:49.560
It happens if you have a lot on your mind.

00:53:49.644 --> 00:53:52.730
Who cares about the name?
You want to enter. That's what counts.

00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:57.401
What? He's entering a competition?

00:53:57.485 --> 00:53:58.319
Him?

00:53:58.402 --> 00:54:01.155
Oh, hey. Our one-day teammate.
Good to see you again.

00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:05.284
He will enter that competition?

00:54:05.368 --> 00:54:09.288
Yes. Our dear Gyeon-U
made a huge decision.

00:54:09.372 --> 00:54:11.958
Choosing the Hanragi Archery Competition
to make a comeback

00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:15.127
can almost be called an iconic move.

00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:17.546
Wait, he's an archer.
Let's call it "an iconic shot."

00:54:18.381 --> 00:54:20.383
-Don't come close.
-Are you serious?

00:54:20.466 --> 00:54:21.968
What did I do now?

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:24.303
Why would you enter
an archery competition?

00:54:24.387 --> 00:54:25.638
Take it back right away.

00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:27.807
I'm not the one who said I'd enter.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:28.975
He…

00:54:29.684 --> 00:54:30.559
What's my name again?

00:54:30.643 --> 00:54:33.020
-Bae Gyeon-U.
-That's it. Bae Gyeon-U wanted to enter.

00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:35.940
I saw you fill in the form just now.

00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:38.985
We made a deal. You don't know anything.

00:54:39.068 --> 00:54:39.944
Stop lying.

00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:41.278
Hey, one-day archery teammate.

00:54:41.362 --> 00:54:44.281
Wearing our uniform
doesn't make you a full-time teammate.

00:54:44.365 --> 00:54:47.243
Why are you raging over an archer
entering an archery competition?

00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:49.370
I mean…

00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:52.164
Sir. He…

00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:56.669
I mean, Gyeon-U is in no condition
to enter a competition.

00:54:56.752 --> 00:54:57.712
Forget it.

00:54:58.838 --> 00:54:59.922
If you're so suspicious,

00:55:00.506 --> 00:55:01.799
check for yourself.

00:55:09.724 --> 00:55:11.517
Sir, can you hand me the form?

00:55:12.143 --> 00:55:13.144
Okay.

00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:14.895
Gyeon-U.

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:19.650
NAME: BAE GYEON-U

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.283
Excuse us, sir.

00:55:27.366 --> 00:55:28.534
Sure.

00:55:29.035 --> 00:55:30.911
-I'm so sorry.
-No, don't be.

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.830
Let's go.

00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:34.123
Bye.

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:41.547
Oh, to be young and in love.

00:55:44.633 --> 00:55:46.844
I made a deal with Bong-su.

00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:48.846
Enter the Hanragi Competition.

00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:50.806
A competition is the best way
to regain your form.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:53.851
It'll be a lot of pressure,
but you need to face it head-on.

00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:55.978
What is archery?
It's all about keeping composure.

00:55:56.062 --> 00:55:58.689
"Bad-mouth me all you want.
You can't get to me."

00:55:58.773 --> 00:56:01.192
It's your chance
to prove that to the whole world.

00:56:01.275 --> 00:56:02.109
Fill out the form.

00:56:03.778 --> 00:56:05.905
Tell him you'll enter
and fill out the form.

00:56:07.073 --> 00:56:09.658
This competition is important to me.

00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:13.704
Hey, isn't archery a solo sport?

00:56:13.788 --> 00:56:15.247
That means I have to participate.

00:56:17.083 --> 00:56:19.168
Of course you may think
you're in it alone.

00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:21.545
But if you turn to look behind you,

00:56:21.629 --> 00:56:23.130
yours truly will be right there.

00:56:23.214 --> 00:56:25.716
You're not alone.
Don't think that you are.

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.218
I'll participate as myself.

00:56:27.301 --> 00:56:28.302
No matter what.

00:56:36.477 --> 00:56:37.937
Let's make a deal, then.

00:56:39.355 --> 00:56:40.606
-A deal?
-Yeah.

00:56:41.232 --> 00:56:43.317
Lend me your body while we're at school.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.610
Then I'll…

00:56:46.362 --> 00:56:47.613
join this competition.

00:56:47.696 --> 00:56:49.323
You'll have my full cooperation.

00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:53.953
Is that self-affirmation?

00:56:54.036 --> 00:56:55.496
That's very important.

00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:56.705
Let me join in.

00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:59.917
You punk.
Give him your full cooperation, okay?

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.086
You are your only rival.

00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:03.921
Fight him and win. Bring it, punk.

00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:05.631
Come at me.

00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:07.967
Let's do it.

00:57:08.551 --> 00:57:09.802
Your deal or whatever.

00:57:13.597 --> 00:57:17.059
We don't know what Bong-su is thinking.

00:57:17.643 --> 00:57:21.605
But I thought I might have an advantage.

00:57:21.689 --> 00:57:23.524
Like it or not, we're sharing a body.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.823
Don't try anything funny,
or I'll kill him!

00:57:32.283 --> 00:57:34.410
It's too dangerous. Your life is at stake.

00:57:34.493 --> 00:57:36.287
I'm pretty hard to kill.

00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:38.581
Well done.

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.041
Because someone

00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:44.003
has worked really hard to protect me.

00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:52.511
When we hold hands tight like this,

00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:56.807
it keeps me from thinking
that I might lose.

00:57:59.435 --> 00:58:01.103
I'm actually really timid.

00:58:01.187 --> 00:58:02.521
But…

00:58:02.605 --> 00:58:04.273
I'm not afraid at all right now.

00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:08.152
Because you're so warm.

00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:11.697
Gyeon-U.

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.032
I like you, Seong-A.

00:58:15.576 --> 00:58:16.452
Now, it's…

00:58:18.454 --> 00:58:19.413
my turn to protect you.

00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:32.468
I like you.

00:58:33.969 --> 00:58:34.970
I mean it.

00:59:42.746 --> 00:59:44.581
Are you having fun playing with kids?

00:59:44.665 --> 00:59:46.208
It's too dangerous.

00:59:46.292 --> 00:59:48.002
Do you know what drives me crazy the most?

00:59:48.085 --> 00:59:51.088
You shouldn't hold
someone's hand so recklessly.

00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:55.301
Parents and children
are bound to break each other's hearts.

00:59:55.384 --> 00:59:57.094
You gave up on me.

00:59:57.177 --> 00:59:58.554
You ditched me for being unclean.

00:59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.807
I can't find a way
to separate you and Gyeon-U.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.351
Just trust me. I have a plan.

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:06.353
I must save only one of them?

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:07.688
That is too cruel.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:08.605
Sorry.

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.400
I won't ever let go.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.782
