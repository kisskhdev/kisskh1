00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.837
You made the right call.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.715
You know how hard it was
to make this happen, right?

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.842
It's our best chance
at getting back on our feet.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.721
Okay, I'll call you when I get back.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:56.515
Yeah, see you in Seoul.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.184
But that woman…

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.109
I'll deal with her.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.444
You should probably hurry.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.613
Well, time will take care of it.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.575
See you.

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:52.279
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY HURRY.
WELL… TIME WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:56.450
EPISODE 9

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.911
The sun went down too fast.

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.872
I know.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.999
I came here to see the sunset,

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.460
but I can't even remember
what color it was.

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.254
The sun did set, right?

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:14.551
Mr. Lee.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.389
Your head's all over the place,
it feels like you're dreaming,

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:23.226
and your heart keeps racing, right?
Like you've done something wrong.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.145
How did you know that?

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.147
I can feel it all.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.444
I kept pretending not to notice

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.821
the feelings I have for you.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.407
I was scared.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.785
So was I.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:41.953
Hmm?

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.789
Are you still scared?

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.083
No, I've forgotten all that.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.878
Watching you stay strong
and smile all the time,

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:53.048
even when I know
it's been way harder for you,

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.967
it makes all the fear I had
feel like nothing.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.553
Fear is never nothing.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.682
You don't know what it's like.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.769
Dying of fear that you might die,
even though you're not dying.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.525
That feeling of wondering if
it's okay to love someone who's dying?

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.443
I don't know it either.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.155
When you came running to me earlier,

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.283
I felt like my heart would burst.

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:24.162
But at the same time, it sank.

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:27.541
All this joy I feel now,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.085
I'll probably forget it soon.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.297
And the one left behind
will remember me without me.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.927
So I keep wondering
if I'm allowed to revel in all of this.

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:43.348
Of course you are.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.936
Me, of all people,
when I'm going to die soon?

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.857
Is it really okay for me to like you?

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:09.833
Is it okay…

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.629
for someone like me to like you?

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.675
Yes.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:20.927
Let's just…

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.555
live in this moment.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.391
I've made my decision.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.268
Then you're in trouble.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.897
You're about to be really happy.

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.254
Wow, it looks delicious.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.007
Enjoy, everyone.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.634
- Enjoy.
- Bon appétit.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.346
- This is definitely a hot place to eat.
- Hmm?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.598
You haven't even tried the food.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.937
I can tell without eating.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:15.524
You can tell from the vibe
that it's a hot spot.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:16.608
Can't wait to dig in.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.987
How come the four of you were together?

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:22.781
Ah…

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.157
Well…

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.577
Ms. Jo burned a hole in my coat
with her cigarette,

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.666
so she bought this for me yesterday,
and I wanted to thank her--

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.335
For goodness' sake.
Talk about dragging it out.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.756
We ran into these two downtown,
had coffee, and were on our way back.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.341
Ah.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.676
And how did you two…

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.181
What were you doing together?

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.976
Uh…

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.019
Well…

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.402
Location scouting.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.737
You know, the sunset was so beautiful.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.615
Thought it might be
a good spot to shoot later.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.035
Yes, the sunset… Very beautiful.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.495
Being pink and all.

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:13.456
It was obviously orange.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.501
- W-Well, orange and…
- Orange…

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.587
- Orangish pink.
- Yeah.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.422
Orangish pink, right.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.257
Like this kind of color, you know?

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.602
Jeha, can I ask you a question?

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:34.728
No.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.521
- Just one.
- No.

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.315
- Just one!
- I said no.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:42.068
Remember what I said last time?

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.654
You don't mind things you normally hate--

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:45.739
Quiet.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.533
And you don't even get tired.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:49.993
I'm tired now. A lot.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.495
Man, that's strange.

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.333
Your voice is cold,
but that look on your face is warm.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.793
I've never seen that look on you before.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:06:59.919
Jeha,

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.129
why were you…

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.757
holding Daeum's hand?

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.931
You saw that?

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.017
Of course I did! I have eyes.

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:16.227
Are you seeing Daeum?

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.563
Can you do that?

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.566
Can't I?

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.237
You could've at least talked to me first.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.658
I'm supposed to protect
my artist's rights, you know.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.285
I'm Daeum's manager after all.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.995
Protecting her rights?

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:35.789
Sounds good.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:36.915
Huh?

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:45.423
What's this camcorder…

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.217
Gosh, Daeum.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.719
This thing…

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.616
Hey, Gyoyeong!

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.952
<i>Would you look at that?</i>

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.912
<i>You little…</i>

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.749
Could you be any more obvious?
And stop leaving your things about.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.836
- Leave what around?
- <i>Your camcorder.</i>

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.130
It's in my hands.
How much is it worth to you?

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.882
Oh, I must've left it behind.
Hey, don't touch that.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.010
But why aren't you in it? You're the lead.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.846
Wait, did you watch it already?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.889
You should've asked
your manager to film you.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.851
I did ask him to film me,

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:38.935
but he's no good.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.605
Guess this pro should step in
and do it for you.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.818
No. Don't even think
about coming down here because of me.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.404
You're too busy to even take a vacation.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.866
Well, the shoot's by the sea anyway.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.325
And my friend is there.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.119
Sounds like a vacation.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.835
You know,
your voice sounds weirdly excited.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:08.840
What? What do you mean,
I sound excited?

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.179
I mean, are you really curious?

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.263
What?

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.390
<i>Maybe I'll tell you</i>

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.393
next time I'm home or not.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.478
What should I do?

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.939
Wait, are you serious? Huh?

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:27.984
It's not something
I can tell you that easily.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:29.444
<i>Tell me right now or else!</i>

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.322
Well, what happened was…

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.783
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.749
Over there.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:43.833
Okay.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.150
Here.

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.614
I'll do it. That was me.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.218
Cut! That's good to go.
Well done, everyone.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.388
- Great work.
- Good job, everyone!

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.849
- Take some continuity shots.
- Great job!

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.309
I'm heading to Seoul now.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.812
You're not thinking
of dying anymore, are you?

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.398
- You've been wearing that a lot.
- Hmm?

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.482
Oh.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.360
Everyone says it looks good. Thanks again.

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:55.321
Why are you thanking me?
I said I'd buy it, so I did.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.620
I thought maybe I should
shake Hyunsang's hand here.

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.331
Those two.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.667
When do you think it started?

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.793
Mmm…

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.461
Not sure.

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.798
Let's go again
from "Thank you for pulling me out."

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.259
Wow, you're so oblivious.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.387
How do you shoot so well
with that kind of awareness?

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:24.434
Well, I don't know
if I should be flattered or offended.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:28.229
It was definitely since the team dinner.
My eyes are never wrong.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.856
Just let it go.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.399
What's the big deal?

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.943
People can catch feelings
when they work together.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.446
That's a bit naive.

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.199
I just hope it doesn't blow up later.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.583
Oh, Eunho, it's your last day, isn't it?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:50.960
Yes.

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.087
Hang on. In that case…

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.215
do you want to shoot the final scene?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.676
- I'll talk to Mr. Lee.
- Me?

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.303
Give it a go.

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.228
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.313
It's Eunho's last day today.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.399
- Right.
- Could he shoot the last scene?

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.072
No, it's fine.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.907
The production will relay it all.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.033
Yeah.

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:26.120
Hello, everyone.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:29.540
Yeah. Let me know
if there are any issues on set.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:35.713
What brings you here?

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.591
Well, why haven't you done
anything about this?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.678
You're the CEO here, Mr. Bu.

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:46.182
Why? What is it?

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.396
Planning to write up a scandal
about those two?

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.649
Man, that would be a disaster.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.318
Production's barely just begun,

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.862
and the actress and the director
are caught up in a scandal!

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.823
Gosh, what a headache that would be!

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.200
The investors would all flip out over it.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.287
Did you actually look at the photo?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.872
That's a hospital. A university hospital.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.875
There's plenty of room for interpretation.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.629
Calm down. It's not like they were
in front of the OB-GYN or something.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.549
Our medical consultant
is in that very hospital.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.135
So the director and actress stopped by

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.929
to consult a big name in the industry.
What's the big deal?

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.306
Without her manager?

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.308
Just the two of them, asking for advice?

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.643
The manager could've waited in the car

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.603
or gone to the restroom.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.814
What can you even prove with one photo?

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.941
It's way too vague.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.777
And what were you doing at the hospital?

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:41.779
Well, I just…

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.073
Look at the <i>Terms of Jealousy</i> scandal.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.451
That only sold more tickets for the movie.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.785
Go ahead, break the story.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.913
I really don't see how that'll hurt me.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:57.920
Just stick to writing down
the tips you're fed, okay?

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:01.424
That's all you've ever done.
What's with the new act?

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.474
Does he take me for some kind of idiot?

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.190
<i>Sincerity.</i>

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:21.069
<i>I'm not asking</i>
<i>for something you don't have.</i>

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.654
We weren't always like this.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.411
What happened to us?

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:34.874
Get some rest.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.177
Yes?

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.061
Oh, man.

00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:57.939
I couldn't last a month like I promised.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:14:59.857
I'm heading to Seoul now.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.568
You're not thinking
of dying anymore, are you?

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.696
Thank you for pulling me out.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.573
You'd better be thankful.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.619
There are so many things
you can only do when you're alive.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.038
Take care of yourself.

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.290
I'll take care of myself too.

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:30.513
You make me want…

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.895
to keep living, Hyunsang.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:44.527
<i>In your version of</i> Love in White…

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:46.988
does the ending…

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.158
stay the same?

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.829
No.

00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.208
In the end…

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.005
In the end, she'll probably die.

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.387
- Cut.
- That's a cut.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:13.973
Are we going with this?

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:15.099
Hang on a second.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.064
THEN HOW ABOUT I…

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:35.161
Jungwoo, can I talk to you for a moment?

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.245
Sure, go ahead.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:37.914
Uh…

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:41.667
What if Hyunsang stayed with Gyuwon

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.336
for just one more day?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.546
Why? Would that mean much?

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:52.220
Isn't Hyunsang the kind of guy
who coldly walks away from a sick woman?

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.971
You're right. That's true, but…

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.016
I've been rethinking the ending.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:02.104
Does that mean he loves her now,
like he did in the original?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.858
Well, I'm on Team Original anyway.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.193
I'll give it a try.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:14.283
So you're thinking of leaving
the door open for Gyuwon and Hyunsang.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:16.869
I'm still thinking about it.

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.872
I'm all for it.
That's what <i>Love in White</i> should be.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:25.253
Then let's adjust the angle to make it
a bit more hopeful and beautiful.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.130
You're scene's not over yet, Eunho.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.716
Mr. Lee.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.510
Yes?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.307
- Go on.
- No, I'll tell you later.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.060
Let's do it.

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.770
Thank you for pulling me out.

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:44.522
You'd better be thankful.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.775
There are so many things
you can only do if you're alive.

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:50.486
Then how about I stay one more day?

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:53.030
Seems a shame to leave on this note.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.409
I'd love that.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.958
Cut! Okay.
That's good.

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.876
We're good to go!
That's it for today!

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.461
Great work, everyone!

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.131
- Well done, everyone.
- Great job.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:12.883
- Good job.
- Great work!

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.468
- Great job!
- Well done!

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.928
Thank you.

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.889
Great work, everyone.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.141
Great work.

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.644
Mr. Lee.

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:25.688
Great work today.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:26.856
You did well too.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.367
- You're going straight into another shoot?
- I take the work that comes in.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.495
Guess I won't see you until spring.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.331
Yeah.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.793
I wanted to see
the cherry blossoms in Seoul with you.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.379
But I know you wouldn't go with me.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:53.924
I'm joking.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.719
You know I can get clingy.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.807
Eunho.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:07.063
I'm glad I got to see you
one more time like this.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.648
This won't be the last time.

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.651
You always act like it's the last time.
It hurts, you know.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.698
Let's shake hands.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.376
Take care of yourself, Eunho.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.295
Take care of yourself, Daeum.

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:36.217
Ah. Why's your hand so cold?

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:57.655
He's gone, right?

00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:58.906
Your first love.

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:01.784
Yes.

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:03.494
He's gone.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.871
First love, long ago.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:32.064
I feel at peace now that
my competition's out of the picture.

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:39.947
I'm a little worried, though.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.117
What if you start acting
all petty and jealous?

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.036
Could you really be that type of guy?

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.330
All humans…

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.623
Well…

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.585
All men are the same.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.171
Men?

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.339
Yes. Why? What?

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.343
Seriously, what's with you?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.435
I don't know. Did I lose my mind?

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.562
That's cute.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:13.856
Cute?

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.525
You acted jealous to make me laugh,
didn't you?

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:20.404
Yes, well…

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:22.740
I wanted to laugh too.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.826
I think your laugh is funny.

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:31.081
You know, Mr. Lee…

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.920
Why did you change

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:38.172
that scene earlier?

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.508
I thought Hyunsang would feel different

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:44.303
when he looked at Gyuwon,
and would want to live now.

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:50.559
He'd want to stay by Gyuwon's side too.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.812
Like you do?

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.525
Yes, like I do.

00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.568
Looks like Gyuwon pulled it off.

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:35.646
Then…

00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:38.899
do you think our movie's ending

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:41.777
could change as well?

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.407
I've been reading
my mother's original draft every day.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.658
I keep wondering

00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:49.994
why she chose that ending.

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:55.291
Even when she was dying
and her husband took her script,

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:59.169
why did she talk about love
as something beautiful?

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:02.715
That's why

00:23:03.674 --> 00:23:06.969
I want to leave the ending of our movie
a little more open.

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:09.805
I want to take a deeper look at it.

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:11.807
Are you sure?

00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.478
Will you help me?

00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:20.357
We said we'd look for it together.

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:24.904
Yes, let's keep looking.

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:27.740
Together.

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:43.380
We've walked two laps already.

00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:47.718
I used to do about 30
when I was in better shape.

00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:51.972
And who did you walk 30 laps with?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.850
Uh…

00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:57.269
Shall we go for another lap?

00:23:58.854 --> 00:23:59.855
We should head in.

00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:01.941
You need your rest.

00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:04.485
Mmm.

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:16.038
Well, I can't go unless you let go.

00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:22.920
Oh, of course.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.799
I don't want to let go.

00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:32.054
Or let you go.

00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:36.392
We'll see each other tomorrow.

00:24:39.353 --> 00:24:40.646
- I'm going in.
- Okay.

00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:08.090
Is this better?

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.174
Or this?

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:12.302
Hey, if you're not eating it,
stop messing with the food.

00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:16.849
Mr. Bu said it was for consulting,

00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:18.726
but you never know.

00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:22.938
Why would a director and actress
be at a university hospital together?

00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:25.399
If we spin this right,

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.317
it could really take off.

00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:34.783
You should've just done what I said.

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:35.909
What is this crap?

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:39.038
Mr. Noh,

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:43.125
you think I lasted 20 years
in this industry by accident?

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.460
Pardon?

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.795
I've had it with scumbags

00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:50.799
twisting disgusting stories
to screw over actresses.

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:53.343
It makes my skin crawl.

00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:54.636
Got it?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.015
CEOs, man. From the studio or the agency.

00:25:58.098 --> 00:26:01.435
They only come crawling
when they need something.

00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:05.105
Isn't that spicy?

00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:10.402
Pour me a drink.

00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:13.655
Just you wait.
I'm going to hit them where it hurts.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.535
Beyond Entertainment's already a mess
with Chae Seoyoung likely leaving.

00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:20.412
It's just a waste of time.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:22.664
Always late to the story.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:25.542
Ms. Go is never letting go
of Chae Seoyoung.

00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:28.879
She's already desperate
to find "the next Chae Seoyoung."

00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:32.216
I heard she even reached out to Nam Jaein.

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:37.471
What? Ms. Go just asked her questions
because she went to school with Lee Daeum.

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:41.975
Oh.

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:10.796
CHAE SEOYOUNG

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:14.800
You've been smiling a lot.
The mood on set is better than ever.

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.680
It's very surprising that someone
as tightly wound as you

00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:22.057
could be so relaxed on set.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:24.768
I just decided

00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:27.020
to think differently.

00:27:27.688 --> 00:27:28.689
Is that so?

00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:30.399
I did too.

00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:39.783
Did you think it was a compliment
when I said you looked good?

00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:46.081
I told you that I won't support you
no matter what choice you make.

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.378
So what are you going to do? I mean…

00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:55.507
What do you want to do?

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:05.684
Here.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.232
It's past 11:00 p.m.,

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:15.444
and you're okay with drinking
high-fructose syrup?

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.155
Oh. Want me to get you something else?

00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:21.366
No, it just threw me off.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.368
You eat a ton of food too.

00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:26.163
Doesn't the director say anything?

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:28.665
Like, "You're playing
a terminally ill character.

00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:31.585
Shouldn't you be responsible
and watch what you eat?"

00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:41.345
As long as I look fine, isn't that enough?

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.640
What are you trying to say is the problem?

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.141
Lee Daeum as a person.

00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:47.684
Nam Jaein.

00:28:47.768 --> 00:28:50.437
I just want to get along with you
like we used to.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.730
Don't do this.

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:56.193
Did we ever get along?

00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:58.946
You remember things differently.

00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:03.533
Why are you so angry with me, hmm?

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:06.703
Just tell me. This is really frustrating.

00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:08.914
I'm the one who's frustrated.

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:17.923
Wow. It's a lot bigger than my room.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.591
Must be nice.

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:21.969
You're lucky.

00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:23.971
Life must be so exciting.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:44.908
What makes Daeum now so different
from who I was back then?

00:29:44.992 --> 00:29:47.077
No.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.205
Why is the Lee Jeha now
so different from the Lee Jeha then?

00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:53.166
Your feelings for Daeum…

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.878
Are you absolutely sure
they're not cheap pity, but real love?

00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:58.463
Yes.

00:29:58.547 --> 00:29:59.840
I'm sure.

00:30:02.426 --> 00:30:05.012
Seoyoung, I just…

00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:07.931
decided to live in the moment.

00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:10.183
And the one who made me think that way

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:11.977
was Daeum.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.148
I'll understand whatever you choose to do.

00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:18.567
I just hope it doesn't end up

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:21.945
circling back and hurting you.

00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:27.492
You must be doing really well now,

00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:30.746
to have the luxury of
poking at others' pain.

00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:47.012
Hello?

00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:50.432
Who is this?

Who is it?

00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:29.471
Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Lim?

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:30.764
Are you okay?

00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:32.599
Sorry? What do you mean?

00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:33.975
You haven't seen it yet.

00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:40.649
Have a nice day, everyone.

Hello, Mr. Bu.

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.177
You should come over.

00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:24.651
- Hello!

00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:25.944

What is it?

00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:03.023
Are the checkup results out?

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:04.816
Is it bad?

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.860
I'll be on set

00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:09.529
from now on.

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:24.794
Mr. Han?

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:26.546
Oh.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:34.888
"The two relied on each other
through the grueling shoot."

00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.891
"After filming was over,

00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:40.977
Lee Daeum would always
go to her director's room.

00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:43.313
On their day off,

00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:45.649
they even went to the hospital together."

00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:48.360
Open parenthesis, question mark,
close parenthesis.

00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:51.905
Mr. Han.

00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:56.409
You're not actually bothered
by a gossip piece like this, are you?

00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:00.914
Of course not.

00:34:01.498 --> 00:34:04.251
I've got way juicier stuff than this.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:05.961
Exactly.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.963
If anything, this is free buzz.

00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:12.384
Mr. Han!

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.012
- What's with all the fuss?
- Mr. Han.

00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:17.305
We have a situation.

00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:27.565
What's this now?

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:29.567
LEE JEHA
AND LEE DAEUM DATING…

00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:31.027
"GIRLFRIEND CASTING"
CONTROVERSY…

00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:34.030
This isn't the kind of buzz we want.

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:37.284
A simple dating scandal is one thing,

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.662
but "fairness" and "equity"?

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:44.666
It's hitting the two issues the public
is hyper-sensitive about right now.

00:34:46.126 --> 00:34:48.086
Noh Huitae, that bastard.

00:34:49.212 --> 00:34:52.716
Two of my higher-ups
are already facing indictment

00:34:52.799 --> 00:34:56.052
over rigged hiring
and preferential bidding.

00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:59.806
I'm only throwing money at this movie
to clean up the crap they made.

00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:01.975
And now the director rigged the audition?

00:35:02.058 --> 00:35:05.020
I'll get a correction piece ready.

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.647
You think a correction's
going to fix this?

00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.610
That article was too nasty.

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:13.486
You must've been so shocked.

00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:16.656
Is going to the director's room
for a meeting a crime?

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.325
Even I've been in that room.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.661
And with your acting skills,
how's that favoritism?

00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.204
Mr. Lee's the one who got lucky.

00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:25.707
Lee Jeha, that bastard.

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.251
I knew this would happen.

00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:29.711
SO "THE LONELY PEOPLE"
WAS RIGGED TOO?

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.296
THE DIRECTOR FOUND
A LEAD AND A GIRLFRIEND

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.131
And Seoyoung?

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:34.591
I can't get a hold of her.

00:35:34.674 --> 00:35:36.176
Can't reach Minhee either.

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:40.597
Get my car ready.
I'm going to Samcheok myself.

00:35:41.097 --> 00:35:42.891
Hey.

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:47.979
You must've thought I was a pushover
because I smile all the time.

00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:50.523
I'm sorry, Mr. Han.

00:35:50.607 --> 00:35:53.526
How do you call yourself a CEO
when you can't even handle a reporter?

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:57.364
Forget the apologies.

00:35:57.447 --> 00:35:59.949
Unless you want to cough up what we paid,

00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:02.786
get the director and actors

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:05.413
to cry, beg, whatever it takes,
in front of the camera,

00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:07.707
and change

00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:10.251
the public's opinion.

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:11.711
Wait, Mr. Han…

00:36:12.379 --> 00:36:14.756
I'll make sure to shut down
this favoritism scandal.

00:36:15.423 --> 00:36:17.258
I'll call you right away, Mr. Han!

00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:20.804
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:24.140

Hello.

00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:49.040
What's with all the chatter?
What, we can't go on with the shoot?

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.960
Just get back to work!

00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:02.679
Hello.

00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:04.305
Hello.

00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:06.766

- Hello.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:07.851
Hello.

00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:15.942
It looks like
someone on set took that photo.

00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:18.445
It does.

00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:21.573
Could I talk alone
with Ms. Chae for a moment?

00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:22.949
Yes, we're done.

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:25.285
Take your time, both of you.

00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:27.120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.170
Isn't that reporter…

00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:40.383
close with Ms. Go?

00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:43.511
It wasn't Ms. Go.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.890
She's not that kind of person.

00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:55.190
Hello.

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:56.524
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:37:58.234 --> 00:37:59.235
Think you can focus?

00:38:00.487 --> 00:38:04.032
Yes. I'll do my best
to love you again today.

00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:09.037
Are you both ready?

00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:11.706
Yes, we're all ready.

Ready.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.482
circling back and hurting you.

00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:40.401
Great work today, Ms. Chae.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.905
- You have one scene left?
- Yes.

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:47.408
Ms. Chae, didn't I tell you?

00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:48.868
That girl's seriously weird.

00:38:48.952 --> 00:38:50.328
"That girl"?

00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.663
Lee Daeum.

00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:54.666
How can she smile right now
like nothing's happened?

00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:58.545
Acting all innocent while slipping
in and out of the director's room--

00:38:58.628 --> 00:39:00.588
I've been to his room.

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:04.050
So have you.
And so have most of the actors here.

00:39:04.634 --> 00:39:09.264
But someone took that photo in secret,
so it looked all sneaky and scandalous.

00:39:10.974 --> 00:39:12.809
It was a scandal waiting to happen.

00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:14.018
By the way,

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:16.187
weren't you two friends?

00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:18.940
Why are you so hostile?

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.947
Wait, are you suspicious of me right now?

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.199
You think I took the photo and leaked it?

00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:29.534
- You're here.
- Yes.

00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:30.785
Come in.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.123
<i>No.</i>

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:36.624
<i>I'm not just suspicious.</i>

00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.460
I actually saw you take that photo.

00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:43.089
Daeum's not the only one
who goes to that room.

00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:45.174
Ms. Chae, you've got this all wrong. I--

00:39:45.258 --> 00:39:47.760
Tearing someone down for your own gain

00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:49.888
turns out to be meaningless.

00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:52.098
Jaein.

00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:53.600
I know it sounds preachy,

00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:55.810
but trust me.

00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:58.187
I figured that out recently myself.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.621
What? Why aren't you at work?

00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:18.708
I quit spectacularly.
Hence, I'm having lunch here.

00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:20.668
Why you little…

00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:23.004
Are you out of your mind?

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:26.966
What did I do to get a kid like you…

00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:30.803
But poor Daeum. What should we do?

00:40:30.887 --> 00:40:33.139
If that stuff starts spreading online,

00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:35.099
her dad's going to see it too.

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:39.270
So we should

00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:41.314
split up our duties.

00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:43.608
You should go to Uncle Junghyo.

00:40:44.192 --> 00:40:45.902
- What about you?
- Mom.

00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:49.656
Not a lot in my life is going to change
by taking a break from work.

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:53.409
You know very well
that I'm still very young.

00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:56.287
I have so much time to spare.

00:40:57.914 --> 00:40:59.791
So if I'm not by Daeum's side right now,

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:02.126
I don't think I could handle it.

00:41:03.503 --> 00:41:04.587
Of course.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.423
That's exactly how I feel too,

00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:09.717
but I was worried
you wouldn't feel the same.

00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:12.178
I knew it! I'm your daughter after all.

00:41:12.261 --> 00:41:13.429
We're so on the same page.

00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:16.516
You're heading there today, right?

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:17.684
Yeah.

00:41:17.767 --> 00:41:18.810
What do you need?

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:20.645
What should we pack first? Let me think.

00:41:21.688 --> 00:41:23.815
- Give me everything you've got!
- All right!

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:25.566
Everything. Right away.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.693
Got it.

00:41:37.996 --> 00:41:39.080
Yes?

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.208
Well, hello.

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:44.544
Hello.

00:41:44.627 --> 00:41:46.838
I came by because I was worried.

00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:49.340
I know you're strong, but still.

00:41:51.884 --> 00:41:52.927
I'm sorry.

00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:55.263
I don't know what to say.

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.015
No, don't worry.

00:41:57.598 --> 00:42:00.435
Gyoyeong takes such good care of Daeum.

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:03.479
Of course. She's better than me.

00:42:03.563 --> 00:42:05.148
She always has been.

00:42:06.733 --> 00:42:07.984
Lately,

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:11.654
I keep thinking
about when I first met Daeum.

00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.371
My mom told me to bring you.

00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:27.754
Here, ta-da!

00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:30.048
Welcome, my valued guest.

00:42:30.131 --> 00:42:31.257
Here.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.467
Let's eat.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.885
So, you don't have a mom?

00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:36.304
Hey, Gwak Gyoyeong.

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:40.141
What? I don't have a dad either.

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.393
I just wanted to tell her that…

00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:44.562
Man, you little…

00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:46.397
Stop that. Quiet.

00:42:46.939 --> 00:42:48.649
It's all right, darling.

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:51.903
At first, I thought she was a gloomy kid,
so I felt bad for her.

00:42:52.862 --> 00:42:57.366
But I was wrong. She was always smiling
and always ate so well.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.077
And after she got sick,

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.621
she smiled even more

00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:03.706
so her father wouldn't be sad

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.792
and people wouldn't worry about her.

00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:08.628
She never once showed she was in pain.

00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:10.546
Yes, I know.

00:43:12.715 --> 00:43:14.967
I'm not worthy of being her father.

00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:17.136
No one's unworthy of being a parent.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.930
Don't give up.

00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:20.973
I know I shouldn't.

00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.315
But no matter how much I try,
I don't see any hope ahead.

00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:31.734
I keep losing faith.

00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:39.075
It's time to think
about another kind of hope.

00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:42.829
Not as a doctor, but as a father.

00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:45.873
<i>Think about how lonely she must've been,</i>

00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:48.251
<i>standing all alone back then</i>

00:43:50.002 --> 00:43:51.754
in the middle of that schoolyard.

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:55.842
Think about what she really wants,
and try to enjoy that

00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:58.261
in the time she has left, together.

00:44:01.597 --> 00:44:03.307
I know, but it's not easy.

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:08.688
I'm actually terrified.

00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:10.523
I know.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.191
But still,

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:14.026
Dr. Lee,

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:16.445
you have to stay strong.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.826
Thank you.

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:36.799
- Everyone, eat.
- Okay.

00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:48.186
Figured you'd be more comfortable
sitting away from them today.

00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:49.562
Let's eat.

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.689
Enjoy your meal.

00:44:54.233 --> 00:44:55.359
Hey, Daeum!

00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:58.404
Why aren't you eating?

00:44:58.487 --> 00:44:59.572
Got no appetite?

00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:05.328
Man, I came all the way
to Samcheok for a delivery.

00:45:05.912 --> 00:45:07.496
Now give me my tip.

00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:09.498
Gyo.

00:45:09.582 --> 00:45:11.876
Hey, catering's not bad here.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.421
My mom's lunch box
has some competition.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.716
Why are you here? What about work?

00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:23.930
I'm on leave.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.265
On leave? Why would you do that?

00:45:29.227 --> 00:45:30.895
This bond! This friendship!

00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:33.231
What exactly is your relationship?

00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:38.653
We love each other.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.530
- Respect.
- Come on, dig in.

00:45:42.782 --> 00:45:44.659
- You like it?
- It's so good!

00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:02.593
Mr. Noh! Why weren't you picking up?

00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:05.179
The article did better than I expected.

00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:07.390
I got caught up writing a follow-up.

00:46:07.473 --> 00:46:10.059
You're keeping me anonymous, right?
You promised.

00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:12.561
Of course.
Trust is everything in this business.

00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:15.398
And Ms. Go and Chae Seoyoung
can't know about this.

00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:17.275
I mean it. It has to be a secret.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.985
<i>I got it.</i>

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.951
You've got some pipes on you.

00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:30.496
I bet this recording
came out crystal clear.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.331
Easy now.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.959
Would you look at that?

00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:36.877
What the hell do you want?

00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:43.134
You should use that brain of yours
and be more careful.

00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:44.302
What?

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.890
Turn on the water first
so no one hears you, you crazy little…

00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:55.688
"Thinking about when I'll die…"

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.655
Sit down.

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.013
You're the lead.

00:47:30.056 --> 00:47:31.724
You fought like hell

00:47:32.308 --> 00:47:34.226
to come all the way up here,

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.354
so stand tall and hold your ground.

00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:42.860
I can't do this.

00:47:44.653 --> 00:47:45.654
I just can't.

00:47:45.738 --> 00:47:48.407
I can't keep pretending
to be nice and understanding.

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.535
I don't like you. I resent you.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.914
But I can't figure out
why I feel that way.

00:47:54.997 --> 00:47:57.625
I just can't hate you.
You've done nothing wrong.

00:47:58.167 --> 00:47:59.877
You're just holding on

00:48:00.586 --> 00:48:02.088
and trying your best.

00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:12.348
Ms. Chae.

00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:14.725
So I decided…

00:48:17.937 --> 00:48:20.314
to stick it out
and finish this film with you.

00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:22.608
If we keep going,

00:48:23.818 --> 00:48:26.487
maybe I'll figure out
why I don't like you so much.

00:48:27.279 --> 00:48:28.989
You just be the tragic lead.

00:48:29.782 --> 00:48:31.784
I'll be the villain who gives her hell.

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.161
Let's finish this together.

00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:38.666
Okay.

00:48:51.637 --> 00:48:53.556
Sorry, give me a moment alone.

00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:55.391
- Sure.
- Sorry about this.

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.393
Thank you.

00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:11.866
First, Youngjin's caught
in a hiring scandal,

00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:16.036
and now the film they invested in
is in this casting scandal.

00:49:17.288 --> 00:49:19.290
They're threatening to pull their money.

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:21.959
And of course, they are. I would too.

00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:24.211
But you know that's not true.

00:49:25.463 --> 00:49:26.839
I'll release the audition tape

00:49:28.174 --> 00:49:29.800
and the score sheets too.

00:49:29.884 --> 00:49:31.469
Like anyone would believe those.

00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:33.762
The public's already made up their minds,

00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:35.639
and you're going to go out there

00:49:35.723 --> 00:49:37.808
saying, "We were totally fair back then"?

00:49:37.892 --> 00:49:41.770
Yes, even if they don't believe us.
Even if it's foolish. I want to do that.

00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:45.316
Hold on. Let me think this through.

00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:48.694
Daeum and I,
we don't have time to wait it out.

00:49:48.777 --> 00:49:50.738
Don't be dramatic. You have time.

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.115
You can't just
rush into something like this.

00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:54.950
You know what I mean.

00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:56.285
Know what?

00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:58.454
That Daeum's terminally ill.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:04.668
Both you and Mr. Han
knew that from the beginning.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.132
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:11.550
Hmm?

00:50:11.634 --> 00:50:13.302
Oh, man. Hey--

00:50:18.224 --> 00:50:20.100
<i>Some people might even find it boring.</i>

00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:22.728
<i>But it'll never be boring to me.</i>

00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:26.815
<i>When that "terminal illness" cliché</i>
<i>is your life,</i>

00:50:26.899 --> 00:50:28.526
<i>every day feels like</i>
<i>the climax of a movie.</i>

00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:31.737
<i>This will be real method acting.</i>

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:34.365
<i>I have one condition.</i>

00:50:35.658 --> 00:50:36.784
<i>Don't die.</i>

00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:41.747
They're practically filming a whole movie.

00:50:43.082 --> 00:50:45.584
Can I be very blunt here?

00:50:45.668 --> 00:50:48.671
If she dies during the shoot,
then it's a bust.

00:50:48.754 --> 00:50:50.881
But if she dies after we wrap?

00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:53.425
That's a jackpot.

00:50:53.509 --> 00:50:54.635
I got chills.

00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:57.346
That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:50:57.429 --> 00:50:59.056
We're on the same wavelength, then.

00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:00.766
It sure is amusing.

00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:05.145
Will it be a bust or a jackpot?

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.690
Never thought I'd gamble on a movie.

00:51:11.652 --> 00:51:12.695
Let's sign the contract.

00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:16.615
- Hmm.
- Thank you, Mr. Han.

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:18.534
Thank you.

00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:23.372
Let's not tell Mr. Lee
that we know about this, okay?

00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:25.457
You drive me nuts.

00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:28.085
You're a lunatic, you know that?

00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:30.045
Okay, fine.

00:51:31.005 --> 00:51:33.674
We can be totally honest
with each other now, right?

00:51:34.508 --> 00:51:35.718
You want that payout?

00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:39.221
Then we can't have
crap like this blowing up.

00:51:39.805 --> 00:51:41.807
Yeah, I know you must've had a plan.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:46.395
I sent you that tragedy I wrote
hoping you'd know how to sell it.

00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:48.897
Man, that feels good.

00:51:48.981 --> 00:51:50.733
Now we're actually talking.

00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:52.651
But, Seungwon.

00:51:52.735 --> 00:51:56.196
I know I'm a mess and a lunatic, but…

00:51:57.865 --> 00:51:58.907
But…

00:51:59.533 --> 00:52:00.618
I want to live

00:52:01.493 --> 00:52:02.620
differently now.

00:52:02.703 --> 00:52:03.787
Differently?

00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:06.123
How will you live differently?

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:10.085
I'm really in love with Daeum.

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.212
You're actually insane.

00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:14.673
"Really in love"?

00:52:16.759 --> 00:52:19.303
Yes, I'm really in love with her now.

00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:21.055
So help me, please.

00:52:23.057 --> 00:52:25.142
Get a grip, you moron.

00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:27.478
Don't you even understand what she is?

00:52:28.729 --> 00:52:29.730
I do.

00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:31.440
Yeah, at first…

00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:36.695
I told myself
I didn't care if she lived or died.

00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:37.863
But now,

00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:39.948
just…

00:52:47.373 --> 00:52:49.958
Just thinking about her pain
makes it hard to breathe.

00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:55.464
The thought of her dying drives me insane.
So please, help me.

00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:56.715
I'm running out of time.

00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:01.261
I'm running out of time too.

00:53:02.262 --> 00:53:04.848
Mr. Han wants
some big public apology stunt.

00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:07.976
You know what, I'll handle that.

00:53:08.727 --> 00:53:11.480
Just keep her illness under wraps.

00:53:12.564 --> 00:53:13.691
This movie

00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:16.360
is running on Mr. Han's money.

00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:20.030
Mr. Han plans to use her illness
at the perfect moment.

00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:01.822
What are you looking at?

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.371
You see those waves?

00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:11.915
They break apart,

00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:14.918
then come together again.

00:54:16.378 --> 00:54:18.756
I wish my life could be like that too.

00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:21.300
Breaking apart then coming together again.

00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:25.304
Never having to think about the end.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:34.980
Maybe everything that's happening now

00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:37.441
started with me.

00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:41.945
Your illness,

00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:45.032
the footage of your second audition…

00:54:48.368 --> 00:54:51.163
I leaked them
to Seungwon and Mr. Han on purpose

00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:52.789
to secure the investment.

00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:56.043
Don't let the camera bother you.

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.794
We won't use this footage for anything.

00:54:57.878 --> 00:55:01.215
Relax, and talk how you normally do to me.

00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:08.805
I'm off.

00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:19.608
So what?

00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:22.402
You're not the only one who used someone.

00:55:24.238 --> 00:55:25.739
If we're being real,

00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:29.910
a dying girl with six months left
and nothing to lose

00:55:30.536 --> 00:55:33.539
cast a promising director
for her own purposes.

00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:39.294
So don't be sorry.

00:55:42.089 --> 00:55:43.715
We used each other.

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:49.721
And, you know…

00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:51.056
Right now,

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:54.977
everything's going exactly how I wanted.

00:55:55.894 --> 00:55:59.439
All I wanted was
to live like everyone else.

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:03.527
But besides dying,
I've never been like other people.

00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:07.906
No uphill battles. No rough paths.

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:09.324
I was just a dying girl,

00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:11.326
the subject of pity,

00:56:11.952 --> 00:56:14.454
motherless, and all alone,

00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:17.666
so everyone always tried to protect me.

00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:19.418
But actually,

00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:23.589
I never wanted to live
that kind of sheltered life.

00:56:25.007 --> 00:56:26.508
Then how do you want to live?

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:29.595
I want more sadness.

00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:34.308
I want to get hurt more.

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:39.229
Most people go through all that
just by living.

00:56:40.689 --> 00:56:41.732
I never did.

00:56:44.192 --> 00:56:45.193
I told you,

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:49.573
that kind of regret
makes you go a little crazy.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.591
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:10.761
We each broke
the terms of this agreement once.

00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:13.138
So it's pointless now.

00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:16.308
Yes, that's right.

00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:19.895
So…

00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:23.190
this contract has been breached.

00:57:28.028 --> 00:57:29.112
We wrote this

00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:32.699
because we were both scared.

00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:38.330
Scared of being caught and judged.

00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:40.749
And scared of losing the movie.

00:57:42.668 --> 00:57:43.669
But…

00:57:45.087 --> 00:57:46.380
I'm not scared anymore.

00:57:48.006 --> 00:57:50.676
Whatever happens from now on,

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.804
I'm going to go through it with you.

00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:57.432
So will you be on my side?

00:58:00.227 --> 00:58:02.229
We don't have a contract anymore.

00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:06.650
But we still need each other, don't we?

00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:16.660
Oh, excuse me.

00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:19.705
Hello. Do you know where Lee Daeum is?

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.331
Who are you?

00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:28.630
Hello, Mr. Han.

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.632
I was just about to call you.

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.677
I just came up with a good idea.

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:35.345
Excuse me?

00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:37.681
Come to think of it,
we still need Lee Daeum.

00:58:37.764 --> 00:58:39.391
She fits the concept.

00:58:39.474 --> 00:58:42.936
Let's not create any fuss
and just drop Lee Jeha.

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:45.147
Drop? What do you…

00:58:46.106 --> 00:58:48.233
How can we drop the director?

00:58:48.316 --> 00:58:50.235
We save Lee Daeum, and the director…

00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:53.280
Well,
"save" isn't the best word.

00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:55.407
<i>How about it? Amusing, right?</i>

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:56.491
"Amusing"?

00:58:56.575 --> 00:58:58.201
Replace the director,

00:58:58.285 --> 00:59:00.245
and you can keep the investment.

00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:01.913
- <i>Your choice.</i>
- Mr. Han! But--

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:29.316
Before we shoot the night scene,
I have something to say.

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.776
Please gather around.

00:59:48.794 --> 00:59:50.504
I know the article this morning

00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.589
made a lot of noise.

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.841
I'm sorry for causing trouble on set.

00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:57.135
Oh, no need to apologize.

00:59:57.219 --> 00:59:59.679
All kinds of things happen
when you're working.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.224
Exactly. Don't beat yourself up.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.728
Seems like there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.897
Well, that misunderstanding is half true

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.441
and half false.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:16.613
It's not true
that I held personal feelings

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.783
for Daeum during the audition process.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.285
And the photo of her coming to my room,

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.329
that was for a work meeting,

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.331
just like all the other actors.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:28.542
Right. We figured as much.

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:35.715
Also,

01:00:37.008 --> 01:00:38.093
I do like Daeum.

01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:48.144
That part is true.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:03.952
I'm sorry!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.168
You don't need to apologize like that.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.635
Come on, Daeum.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.139
It's not a crime to love someone.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.028
Actually…

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:44.826
I wanted to make this movie before I died.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.541
That's why I made it this far.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.921
What does that mean?

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.024
I am…

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.362
terminally ill.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.795
This movie

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.131
is the last movie I'll ever make.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.843
I am an actual terminal patient

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:47.013
who is playing a terminally ill character.

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:50.433
And I

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.728
knew that she was terminally ill…

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.524
and cast her for this movie.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.344
<i>There won't be anyone</i>
<i>left around you in the end.</i>

01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:52.347
So if you don't want to die alone,
at least hold on to me.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.435
I said, keep it under wraps.
Did you see the crew's faces?

01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:59.145
That "you people are nuts" look?

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:02.982
<i>I hope you thought about the fallout</i>
<i>before pulling that stunt.</i>

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:07.153
<i>There are real people behind this film.</i>

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:09.697
<i>I didn't think Mr. Lee would ignore that.</i>

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.368
This is 100% going to fall apart.

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:14.744
Get out before it blows up.

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:17.455
I told him to drop you, Mr. Lee.
