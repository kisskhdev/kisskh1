<i>There's a warm moment
at the end of every film</i>

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.359
<i>where it reads the names
of everyone involved.</i>

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.821

<i>movies, like life,</i>

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.118
<i>race tirelessly toward the ending.</i>

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.086
Ready.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:28.755
Action!

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:35.864
<i>And sometimes…</i>

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.161
<i>Just when we think the ending is here…</i>

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.628
<i>That's when life begins.</i>

OUR MOVIE

EPISODE 1

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.601
The two lead actors
of <i>The Lonely People,</i>

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.812
who delivered outstanding performances

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.480
with a wide range of emotions,

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.607
Chae Seoyoung and Kim Sungwoo.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.275
Please say hello.

00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:14.194
Great.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.822
Please look toward your right.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.158
Now please look toward your bottom right.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.787
Could you look toward your left now?

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.498
A lot of photographers are here today.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.708
And back to center, please.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.963
Could we ask the two of you
for a charming pose?

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.175
You both look so lovely.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.221
THE LONELY PEOPLE

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.142
We just received some very sad news.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.945
- Jeha.
- One of Korea's greatest directors,

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.562
Mr. Lee Duyoung,

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.148
has passed away at the age of 70.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.192
The press event
will now take a brief pause

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.862
per the production company's request.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.452
5 YEARS LATER

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.454
<i>You better come to the premiere tomorrow.</i>

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.789
<i>It's at 2:00 p.m., okay? Don't forget.</i>

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:09.291
<i>Have some decency, will you?</i>

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.750
<i>This is Chae Seoyoung's big return</i>

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:14.337
<i>and everyone except for camera, from art
and music to editing and color grading,</i>

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:18.383
<i>they're all from</i> The Lonely People <i>team!</i>
<i>On top of it all, I'm the producer again.</i>

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.469
<i>Every single person here
got their start with you.</i>

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.972
<i>If you don't show up,
you're no better than an animal, man.</i>

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:28.018
<i>So please,
come out into the world again, okay?</i>

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.687
<i>And as for Seoyoung…</i>

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.689
<i>Well, I'll make sure
you don't run into her.</i>

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:37.360
Why are you bringing her up?
There's nothing between us now.

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:39.154
<i>Look at that, he's alive.</i>

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:43.658
<i>Also, there's the thing
I mentioned a while ago.</i>

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.382
<i>Are you really not doing</i> Love in White...

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.378
LOVE IN WHITE

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.422
"White"? What a joke.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:04:59.925
THE CHASE

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.260
<i>"Sophomore slump."</i>

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.012
<i>Do you know that phrase?</i>

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.058
<i>It's also known as the second-year slump.</i>

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.811
<i>It's when an athlete or artist</i>

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.814
<i>has a great first season or debut project,</i>

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:18.360
<i>but then takes quite a while
to get to the next one.</i>

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.197
<i>It's not so different
from our own lives, is it?</i>

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:26.159
<i>Even in romance.
Getting to that first kiss is one thing,</i>

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:30.497
<i>but figuring out how to land the second?
That's the real challenge.</i>

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.502
<i>It's Tuesday, the second day of the week,
and I'm your host Joo Hyunyoung.</i>

00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:47.806
Are you all right?

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.937
Yes, I'm completely fine.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.730
I'm fine!

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.109
Thank you.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.194
Thank you. Thank you.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:04.030
Thank you!

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.265
Skip to the 2:40 and 20:18 marks.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:31.850
For what?

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:35.228
You know, the stuff
Park's only good at directing.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.481
I don't know why,

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.067
but Chae Seoyoung being a divorcée

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.278
just makes it hotter, doesn't it?

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:47.991
Well, being divorced is hip now.
But are there only two scenes of that?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.244
Quality over quantity, my friend.
It's Director Park.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.705
I bet those love scenes are killer.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:56.833
You're all disgusting.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:02.130
Excuse me, were you talking to me?

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.384
Yes.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:07.469
Get out of my way.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.012
I'm trying to get off.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:19.064
Hey. Isn't that bastard Lee Jeha?

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.231
Lee Jeha?

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.901
Oh, Lee Duyoung's son.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.153
What, has he been in mourning
for three years?

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.489
No, it's been way more than three years.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.532
Why is he here all of a sudden?

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.986
"THE DISCOVERY OF ROMANCE"
PRESS AND INDUSTRY SCREENING

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.297
Hello, everyone.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.633
I'm the producer, Bu Seungwon.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.219
Thank you so much for coming.

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.515
Hello! I'm Park Byeongsik,
director of <i>Discovery of Romance</i>.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:59.437
Honestly, I was fueled by anger.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.399
The rumors were nonstop after my divorce,

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.402
so I thought I'd just show them
what I could do.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.695
See?

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.822
Isn't it nice to be out like this for once?

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.867
I only came because you asked me
to fill a seat, but this place is packed.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.953
I've shown my face, so I'm leaving.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.621
Come on, where are you going?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.666
- We still have stuff to talk about.
- Not interested.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.502
Seriously, man?
I'll keep trying until you are.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.133
I can't even write my own stuff,
and you want me to do a remake?

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.636
You talk about <i>Love in White</i>
like it's some film by a stranger.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.221
This is your father's film.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.639
Your father wasn't a stranger.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.017
We're only connected biologically.
I cut ties with him a long time ago.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.649
And who even likes
that kind of melodrama anymore?

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.933
Just stick to what you know,
the stuff that makes money.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.445
Like that.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.613
Melodrama or not,

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.575
if I lay my finger on it,
it rakes in the money.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.619
I tried to portray the character

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.872
with more subtlety and depth.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.542
I think I was too sensitive
throughout the shoot.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:03.960
- Right, Mr. Park?
- No!

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.378
Of course not.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.630
Seoyoung's still stunning, right?

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.009
She's still got it even after her divorce.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.804
Wait, that look.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:16.723
The stuff of romance films.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:23.396
Looks like you're not done with that story.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.025
What's left to tell, after all this time?

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.694
Look, you can take
what you've been writing for five years

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.446
and shop it around, but it won't work.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.324
You've got to learn to let things go.

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.036
I haven't made the movie
I want to make either.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.414
But I feel like it could happen
if you help me, man.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.084
I'm not asking you to make anything weird.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.295
- This was your father's...
- Seungwon.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:49.839
I'm not doing it.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:50.924
I just…

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.593
Despise that film.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.435
You know,

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.647
what if we surround these alliums
with baby's breath?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.524
Would that be weird?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.276
If I did it, it might work.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.904
If you did it, it might be a disaster.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.115
Got it.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.992
Why do you never
take your nice arrangements home?

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.244
This is all money, you know.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:22.413
I know! It does seem like such a waste.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.207
Then just take them.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.001
I can't.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.212
I'll get in trouble if I do.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.257
Did you all enjoy the movie?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.759
Here's Director Lee.
I had to drag him over here.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.554
Director Lee.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.472
This is Director Joo Inyoung.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:42.225
She went to film school
and won an award at Mise-en-scène.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:43.977
I'm a big fan.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.312
<i>The Lonely People</i> was sensational.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.565
Thank you for the kind words.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:52.861
Ah. Jeha, Chae Seoyoung and I
all had our debut with that one.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:56.531
Honestly, Seoyoung wouldn't have
come this far if it wasn't for that film.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:57.615
Same goes for me.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.409
I'll never get used to that.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.120
- Oh! Speak of the devil.
- It's always tough.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:03.681
Great job putting yourself out there!

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:06.207
- Congratulations.
- Good work, everyone.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.459
- Congrats.
- What? Mr. Lee?

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.211
You're really here.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.296
Yes.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.840
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.593
I appreciate you coming. My goodness.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.719
Here.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:25.101
I never thought you'd show up, Jeha.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.853
What did you think of the film?

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.148
Well, time just flew by.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.110
Right, because you get totally sucked in.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.946
Who would've thought
it would turn out this good? No one.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.408
You've won a ton of awards,
so you'd probably know.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.411
Do you think we've got a shot
at winning anything?

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.625
We have to win. Absolutely.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:52.212
But you know, no one's ever won
both Best Screenplay and Best Director

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.671
for their debut since Lee here.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.716
It was a romance
and it pulled five million people.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:00.303
Whether you're an actor or a director,
your first project is everything.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.638
It's the start that matters.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:06.267
It's what comes after that matters,
whether you're an actor or a director.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:12.774
Sorry, but I have to head out now.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.317
Excuse me.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.653
Mr. Lee.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.155
You're not busy, are you?

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:23.493
If you are, ditch it.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.787
It's been a while. Let's talk.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.833
Hello!

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:31.918
Hi!

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.419
Hello.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.712
Have you eaten yet?

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.049
- Hello!
- Hello.

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.342
Good to see you!

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.637
How's it going, everyone?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.014
I'll just write this quickly and go change.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:48.393
Lee Daeum, the busiest person alive.
Are you seeing someone these days?

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.230
Why must you rub salt

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.607
in my very open wound?

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.234
I had dreams too, you know.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.988
In movies and TV,
everyone falls in love in hospitals.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.449
So why is someone
as gorgeous as me still single?

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.244
Can't speak for your love life,
but Dr. Kim was looking for you.

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.413
- Give him a call.
- Eh.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.914
Looking for me again?

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.587
Hello.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:17.672
Hello.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:18.756
TASTY RAMYEON

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.384
Come in.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:25.471
Why, it's Da-da-da Daeum.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.854
Wow, that must've been heavy.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.856
I feel bad for always taking from you.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.776
What kind of doctor lives on cup noodles
and instant coffee every day?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.445
You're gonna end up with diabetes.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.447
What the heck is this?

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.532
You know I don't like trying new stuff.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.786
Exactly why I brought something
a little healthier this time.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.039
Healthier, you say?

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.334
What, does it
contain protein or something?

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.337
Well, thank you then.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.758
All right.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.057
Mmm.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.642
It tastes better too, hmm?

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:15.438
So you've been
leaving the hospital a lot lately.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:18.524
It's a secret.

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.613
I'm just curious, that's all.

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:30.036
What, is there anything fun
going on out in the world?

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:31.704
Shh.

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:40.129
I know Mr. Park
likes to mix soju and beer.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.214
Now…

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.341
Ready, action.

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:44.509
That's perfect.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.394
What are you up to these days?

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.773
Uh, me?

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.903
What does a director always do?
Prepare for his next movie.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:09.117
Now I'm really curious
about what kind of movie you're planning.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.577
What kind of masterpiece would it be?

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.872
Aren't you curious, Seoyoung?
Pass me some napkins.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.042
Napkins, behind you.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.253
Oh, yes. Here they are.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:21.963
Here you go, Mr. Park.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.513
All right.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.890
Why don't you drink up?

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:37.395
Looks refreshing.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.108
It's a romance film.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.443
You know, what Lee is best at.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:45.695
He's making one with me.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.657
You ask any director on a break,

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.286
and they always say
they're preparing the next one.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.454
They make one hit,

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.624
and then poof,
they're gone without a trace.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.377
But you said Mr. Lee's different.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:07.216
And you really are different,
seeing how you showed up here.

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:13.139
What's so different? I'm the same.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.434
But it seems like you've taken
quite an interest in me. It's a bit much.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.561
Well, sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.023
What was it like
when you two were together?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.570
Must have been a pretty tough shoot.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.573
Your knack for rudeness
really mirrors your directing style.

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:33.823
I'm going to get some air.

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:50.051
You do know
humility isn't your thing, right?

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:53.221
I honestly have no idea
where that ego of yours comes from.

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:55.223
Hey now, come on.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:58.309
Would you both cut it out? Please.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.479
At least I'm still making movies
one after another.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.273
Isn't that what a director's
supposed to do?

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.235
Movies full of out-of-context
love scenes and nudity?

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.071
The kind people only skip
to whatever the "good part" is?

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.116
Don't you feel sorry
for those poor actors?

00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.956
I don't know how you can laugh
after wasting such talent.

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:25.169
Go easy

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.463
on the soju bombs.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.091
And those box office bombs too.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:34.095
If this one flops too,
that's what, three? No…

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:36.639
Four in a row, is it?

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.724
Hey!

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.060
What the hell did you just say to me?

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.603
"If it flops"?

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.897
It's only the premiere
and you say that crap?

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.166
- You rat!
- Let's not do this.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.377
Mouthing off to someone
who's done this longer than you.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.820
- Let's take a smoke break, Mr. Park.
- This little…

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.113
Get some air, okay?

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:55.408
Look what this industry has become!

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.245
Did you have to go that far?

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.831
That was seriously out of line.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.834
You can't deny his movie was good.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.127
<i>The Lonely People?</i>

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.461
Sure, it was solid.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.047
But was it really a film
five million people needed to see?

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:13.301
- Will you keep it down?
- The big debut from the master's son!

00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:15.303
You're embarrassing yourself.

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:17.930
We were all just curious
what the late Lee Duyoung

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.975
- would have thought about it.
- We get it. You can stop now.

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.811
That's the only reason
five million people went to see it!

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:25.646
Unbelievable. Please calm down.

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.610
Seriously, who does he think he is?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.405
He's just jealous of you.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:36.657
It's inferiority complex.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:40.328
I'll bring him over,
so let's clear the air, okay?

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.331
What misunderstanding?
They were purely facts.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.460
That's low, beating me down
with stone-cold facts.

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:51.964
Congratulations. And sorry too,
for killing the vibe.

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.716
Come on, don't leave yet.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.635
No, I'll stay buried a little longer.

00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:56.761
Not as Lee Jeha,

00:18:58.387 --> 00:18:59.680
but as "Lee Duyoung's son."

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.475
Fine, get outta here.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:03.809
We'll talk later.

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:06.187
CHOIDAEPO BBQ

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.984
Sure, there were some pointless nudity
and love scenes.

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.362
But I did it because I liked the character.

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.657
So, I don't hate the film.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.784
Though I don't like the director.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.999
I'm sorry.

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.503
I know it doesn't mean much now…

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.716
But you were great.
I could tell how hard you must've worked.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:41.055
You know,
my acting got better after the divorce.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.433
Like how breaking up with you
finally set things in motion.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.603
Maybe things only work well for me
when I end it with someone.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.232
Should I just keep dating, break up,

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.484
get remarried, break up again, and repeat?

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:56.862
Want to make me a better actor
and date me for a bit?

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.949
You're drunk. That's enough for tonight.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.286
Director Lee.

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:14.797
Do you still love me?

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.511
If you don't, stop getting upset over me.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.680
Don't act like you regret it.

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.227
It's not because of you. It's just…

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.480
After five years of being stuck,

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:34.942
it feels like I'm rotting away. That's it.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.964
NO SMOKING ZONE

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.961
Oh.

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:20.881
Oh, was that your seat?

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:22.675
No, I'm leaving. You can stay.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:23.759
No, wait.

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:27.429
- Please sit.
- It's fine, really.

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:30.516
I guess I'll stay then.

00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:38.607
GRAPE 100

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.333
I wasn't looking because I wanted one.

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.593
Here.

00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:07.219
Take one.

00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:11.015
I don't want it.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.898
Come on, just take one.

00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:21.859
It's really okay. Please take it.

00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:30.034
You didn't film me, right?
I feel like you did.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.913
- No, I didn't.
- I saw the red light turn on.

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:37.708
No. I really didn't film you.

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:43.380
All right, then. Thanks for this.

00:23:43.464 --> 00:23:46.508
Actually, I got that
from a "buy two, get one free" deal,

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:50.679
so this makes it like I just got two
for the price of two now.

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:51.805
Hmm…

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.974
But it's really okay.

00:23:58.228 --> 00:23:59.730
It's my gift to you.

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.279
Okay.

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.955
Thank you!

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.166
I just wanted to thank you,

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:21.710
that's all.

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.839
Gosh, that's hot.

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.179
Who was that guy?

00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:34.306
Someone you know?

00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:52.408
I'm not sure if
I could say I know him or not.

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:54.868
What does that mean?

00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:57.079
Is he hot?

00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:02.292
He's not bad-looking.

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:03.711
Are you serious?

00:25:03.794 --> 00:25:05.170
Like you would know.

00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.588
You've never even dated.

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:07.965
Hey now,

00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:11.301
there's a difference between
"not doing" and "not getting to."

00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:14.763
- Of course, there is.
- Mmm.

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:17.933
So what's it like
to have never "gotten to" date anyone?

00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:23.272
Freaking fantastic. Satisfied?

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:25.899
Hilarious.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.030
Hey, what's this?

00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:33.157
Where have you been running around lately?

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.366
Did you have a fall?

00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:36.493
Ah.

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.705
This was just a plain old fall. That's it.

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:42.374
You know,
you've been acting strange lately.

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:47.254
Wait, wait, hang on.
I had something to ask you.

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:49.089
Look at this right here.

00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:50.215
What do you think?

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.843
It looks tacky.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.388
What about this?

00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:58.182
Gives me grandma vibes.

00:25:58.265 --> 00:25:59.683
"Grandma vibes"?

00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:00.893
What's the occasion?

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:04.063
Fashion's all about when and where
you're going to wear it.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.608
It's for an important day.

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:10.194
The most important day for me.

00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:23.957
GRAPE 100

00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:42.226
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY LEE DUYOUNG

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:08.585
<i>Stop!</i>

00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:12.923
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:14.091
<i>Let me go!</i>

00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:17.302
<i>Who are you to tell me what to do?</i>

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:20.055
<i>I…</i>

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.809
<i>Have every right to destroy myself!</i>

00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:27.396
<i>No one…</i>

00:27:28.522 --> 00:27:30.899
<i>Has the right to destroy themselves.</i>

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:36.280
<i>The only right we have is to love.</i>

00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:40.117
<i>It's cold. Let's get out of here.</i>

00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:53.505
The door?

00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:55.465
I closed it.

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:57.843
How's your health nowadays?

00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.887
It'd be strange
if I was healthy at this age.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.221
Don't worry about it.

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:03.807
Maybe it's time you took a step back.

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:07.060
There have been a lot of
young people coming in lately.

00:28:07.144 --> 00:28:08.270
Even younger than you.

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.940
I told you,
young people don't watch this stuff.

00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:13.692
Who even likes melodrama anymore?

00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:23.660
Looks like there is one.

00:28:35.339 --> 00:28:36.340
Oh.

00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:37.633
No.

00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:39.468
You don't know me.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.511
No, no.

00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:01.865
I found him.

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:06.328
KIM HYUNCHEOL

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:09.122
KIM JINYEO

00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:11.041
LOVE IN WHITE

00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:23.095
You came to see <i>Love in White</i>.

00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:25.389
It's a great film, isn't it?

00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:31.979
Maybe for people like you
who want to remember it that way.

00:29:34.398 --> 00:29:36.400
Do you have something to say to me?

00:29:36.483 --> 00:29:38.944
Yes. About <i>Love in White</i>.

00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:41.905
You really want
to talk about that film with me?

00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:45.200
I just thought
maybe you didn't understand it.

00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.078
<i>Love in White,</i>

00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:51.081
it's a truly beautiful love story.

00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:54.918
I'm sure it's tear-jerkingly beautiful,
since it's all fake.

00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:56.837
The second my mom passed,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.520
you two went right ahead and made it
like nothing was in your way.

00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:02.634
I guess you really don't understand

00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:04.594
what the writer was feeling.

00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:07.264
The viewer's feelings matter too.

00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:12.477
For some people,
this film could be a filthy memory.

00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:14.312
You still don't get that, do you?

00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:18.400
I just hoped you'd understand
what this film really means.

00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:20.902
And why would I need to?

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.530
You've only seen <i>Love in White</i>
as a finished production.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:27.284
When you have time,
try reading the first draft.

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:30.037
As a writer yourself,
maybe if you read it...

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.330
We're not in any position
to be talking like this.

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:35.000
I'm sorry.

00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:38.795
You're sorry? After all this time?

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.425
Well, that's funny.

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:45.844
Enjoy soaking up what's left of
dear Mr. Lee Duyoung.

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:51.600
The legendary director's masterpiece,

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.811
reimagined by his son for the modern era.

00:30:54.895 --> 00:30:56.688
That's a movie in itself, isn't it?

00:30:56.772 --> 00:30:57.814
Right.

00:30:57.898 --> 00:30:59.608
He's not the type to say yes easily.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.234
We'd have to set it up right.

00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:03.820
We've already got Kim Jungwoo as the lead.

00:31:03.904 --> 00:31:05.447
That's right, Korea's boyfriend.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.370
So if we can just
get Chae Seoyoung on board...

00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:13.121
Okay, sir. I'll explain everything in person.

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:21.630
Isn't it about time you took those?

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:22.839
I told you to keep them.

00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:25.884
They literally say "Lee Jeha".
How long am I supposed to hold on to them?

00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:27.153
BEST DIRECTOR - BEST SCREENPLAY

00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:28.386
Next year,

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.681
Cannes is holding a special retrospective
for your father, Director Lee.

00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:35.519
I'm getting the <i>Love in White</i> remake
into that lineup.

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:38.897
I'll get it in, and you're going to make it.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.858
Easy for you to say.

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:46.404
I think this could be your chance
to face everything head-on.

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:49.366
I'm not interested in going head-on.

00:31:49.449 --> 00:31:51.910
I want to make something that's mine,
in my own name.

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:54.371
Do you even have any money?

00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:57.624
Inheritance? Come on.
Everyone except Director Park knows

00:31:57.707 --> 00:32:00.585
that your dad couldn't make
another film after <i>Love in White</i>

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.546
and just racked up debt.

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:04.589
You dumped all your money
into paying it off!

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.345
You know, this project…

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:11.972
LOVE IN WHITE

00:32:12.055 --> 00:32:13.640
actually went to Park first.

00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:17.936
- What did you just say?
- So answer carefully.

00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:20.355
If you keep refusing it,

00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:22.732
it'll have to go back to Park.

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:24.484
Seungwon…

00:32:24.568 --> 00:32:27.487
Exactly! This film
shouldn't be handled that way.

00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:29.156
That's why I called you.

00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:31.366
That's why I can't let it go.

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.702
Because I know
you're the best one for this job.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:37.164
I don't think I have it in me
to do this right.

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:45.213
HOSPITAL SHUTTLE BUS

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.051
TIME TO EAT

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:53.847
♪ <i>Man, I was so close</i> ♪

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.475
♪ <i>Could've been on that bus</i> ♪

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.647
Everything hurts
and falls apart at this age.

00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:03.982
Why are you making a fuss?

00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:06.359
Enough now!

00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:07.819
Hospital stay?

00:33:07.903 --> 00:33:09.237
You think money grows on trees?

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:10.906
I'm hanging up.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:25.962
Excuse me.

00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:29.132
Would you like some of this?

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:31.134
I'm fine.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.553
Aren't you sweet? You go ahead.

00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:35.263
I'm fasting right now anyway.

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.641
Ah. Okay.

00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:54.115
Is there something on my face?

00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:56.034
You're just pretty.

00:33:57.577 --> 00:33:59.204
But you're way prettier than I am.

00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:00.497
Oh, come on.

00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:04.125
What's pretty about an old,
shriveled-up granny?

00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:07.504
That's what makes you beautiful.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.882
You really are much prettier.

00:34:13.927 --> 00:34:16.721
You reached the end
of your savings plan!

00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:17.806
Congratulations.

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:19.683
Yes, thank you.

00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:20.976
How would you like to proceed?

00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:24.229
Could you transfer the funds
to this account?

00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.647
Of course, I can do that.

00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:29.401
So that clears all the debt
tied to the house, right?

00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:31.528
Must've been tough,
covering it month by month.

00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:32.737
I'm happy for you.

00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:34.906
Here's the key.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.119
Five years was too long to pay it off.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:41.997
I'm sorry.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.082
I'm the one
who owes your father an apology.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:46.543
Times got tough, you know.

00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:49.879
It's okay. You didn't sell the house.

00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:51.089
That's enough for me.

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:53.925
- Take care.
- You too.

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:42.432
That's that.
Keep up the good work, everyone.

00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:44.601
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:45.810
Great work.

00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:47.187
Let's dig in.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.398
- Mom.
- Oh, my baby!

00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:51.816
When did you get here?

00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:55.820
Do you want a slice of apple? Here.

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.416
Don't forget to eat.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.128
<i>Try reading the first draft.</i>

00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:38.757
<i>As a writer yourself, maybe if you read it,</i>

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.717
<i>you'd understand the writer's feelings.</i>

YU EUNAE

00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:19.899
COMPLETED SEPTEMBER 17, 1996

00:39:19.983 --> 00:39:22.569
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:39:27.657 --> 00:39:29.075
LOVE IN WHITE

00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:12.368
How could it be?

00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:17.457
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:40:49.906 --> 00:40:54.744
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO DESTROY MYSELF

00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:08.049
Scene 31 feels a bit flat to me.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:11.803
What do you think, Nam?
You know, in <i>Love in White</i>.

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.473
The scene where they meet again.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:16.975
Even when I was writing it,

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:20.687
I kept second-guessing myself, you know?

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.230
"Is this right?"

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:24.399
So I rewrote it again and again.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:27.026
But you're telling me
it all came together?

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.446
That's the stuff
I need you all to look out for.

00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:10.945
How's Seung…

00:42:11.988 --> 00:42:14.574
No. How is Mr. Bu doing?

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:16.951
He never checks in since he went solo.

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:19.495
He's the same as always.

00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:21.914
Seems to be doing well.

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.252
THE CHASE

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.213
BLACK SUN

00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:34.302
You know how it is these days.
The market's tough.

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:39.849
You'll at least read it, right?
I think with a few tweaks...

00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:43.227
Director Park sat on this one
for two years.

00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:46.272
It didn't work out,
but the premise is solid.

00:42:46.355 --> 00:42:47.482
Take a look.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:51.360
Maybe you could give it a spin
in your own style, you know?

00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:53.988
I'll pass.

00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:56.824
Well, give me a call
if you change your mind.

00:42:56.908 --> 00:42:58.910
Hello, Mr. Jeong!

00:42:58.993 --> 00:43:00.411
- Oh, Mr. Park.
- Gosh.

00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:04.582
Fancy seeing you here.

00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:06.209
Right.

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:09.003
It would've been nice
to grab a meal together,

00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:11.214
but I've got plans.

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:17.720
Sorry, I feel like I wasted your time.

00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.514
No, please. Carry on.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.977
I guess he knows
how to be polite to a producer.

00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:30.274
I should get going.
Seems like you have plans with Mr. Park.

00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:33.653
Yes, it's about the project
he's doing after <i>Love in White</i>.

00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:35.404
Pardon?

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:37.907
<i>Love</i>… <i>Love is White</i>?

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.660
Oh, of course.
I heard you were at the top of the list,

00:43:40.743 --> 00:43:42.829
but you turned it down for good.

00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:45.498
Park said he's doing it in his usual,

00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:47.166
you know, very sexual style.

00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:49.335
At this rate, <i>Love in White</i>

00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:51.671
might as well be <i>Love in Red</i>.

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:57.468
Hey, Lee!

00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:10.106
If this one tanks,
how many in a row is that for you?

00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:12.692
Are you really doing it?

00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:14.569
You mean, <i>Love in White</i>?

00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:17.280
I'm considering the offer.

00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:19.407
I know you've only done one film,

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.535
but you're still a director.
You know how tacky that film is.

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:24.704
Of course, I know.

00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:27.248
What, do I need
your permission or something?

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:29.000
To direct <i>Love in White</i>?

00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:32.086
Would you back out if I said no?

00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:37.607
You're still close with Seoyoung, right?

00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:40.261
I've got her in mind
for another spicy role.

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.425
Can you put in a good word?

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.766
Don't want to?

00:44:46.475 --> 00:44:47.476
No, I don't.

00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:50.813
What the...

00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:55.359
Why so scared?

00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:57.570
You out of your mind? I'm your senior!

00:44:58.154 --> 00:44:59.197
You're right.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.327
Maybe I am losing my mind.

00:45:21.219 --> 00:45:24.931
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:35.983
We need some serious
stripping for this genre to work.

00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:39.987
Yeah, sure. We've got to make it work.

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:43.616
Speaking of which,
can't we get Chae Seoyoung?

00:45:44.784 --> 00:45:46.244
Not like last time.

00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:49.705
This time, we explicitly state
the level of nudity in her contract…

00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:51.516
GIVE ME TIME TO REWORK IT.
COLD NOODLES. YOUR TREAT.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.917
…so she can't back out of it.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.753
Why are you so obsessed
with stripping people down?

00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.713
They'd catch a cold in this warm weather.

00:45:59.048 --> 00:46:01.676
Our investor's starting drama again.

00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:03.719
I'll call you, okay?

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.639
Wait, you're leaving?

00:46:06.722 --> 00:46:07.932
Aren't we eating?

00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:09.934
I'm heading out for the day.

00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:11.143
Yes, sir.

00:46:12.937 --> 00:46:14.313
PYEONGYANG COLD NOODLES

00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:18.025
This was your plan all along, right?

00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:20.194
I don't have plans.

00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:23.531
I didn't have a reason to do it,
but now I do.

00:46:24.323 --> 00:46:27.034
Let's make it better than your father's.

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:29.495
Whatever you want to do,

00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:31.789
I'm here to support you 100%.

00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:35.376
Okay, so we got the director.

00:46:36.085 --> 00:46:39.005
And for actors, let's see…

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:41.882
How about Chae Seoyoung?

00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:44.969
She absolutely lit up

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:47.513
when she heard you were directing again.

00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:50.599
Maybe she still has a thing for you?

00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:52.768
Go on at your own risk.

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:54.186
Can't you see it?

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.604
Back in the day,

00:46:55.688 --> 00:46:59.150
she was just a rookie who'd cry all night
from one note you gave her,

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:02.028
and now she's a heavyweight
in the industry.

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:04.572
She was married but is now single.

00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:08.117
So you want me
to reel in the great Chae Seoyoung?

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.536
If you don't lock her in now,
you never will.

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:13.414
The timing's perfect.
She's loyal, you know.

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.833
I don't want to make a film out of loyalty.

00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:17.752
This is all about investment, man.

00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:20.504
If Seoyoung signs on, the money follows.

00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:22.631
I'd have to write the script first.

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.259
I'm not writing with anyone in mind.

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.804
Oh, and like I told you,

00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:31.640
I need at least two months
for the rewrite.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.728
Is there a way you can do it in one?

00:47:36.312 --> 00:47:37.772
The original's from the '90s.

00:47:39.148 --> 00:47:42.068
Updating it to the present day
changes more than you think.

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:47.698
What we need is realism.

00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:51.994
I need a consultant
for depression and terminal illness.

00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:53.996
You have to connect me to one ASAP.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.290
I got chills.

00:47:56.374 --> 00:47:57.541
So brazen,

00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:00.628
barging in
and shamelessly asking for everything.

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.755
You haven't changed one bit!

00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:07.093
Jeha.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.428
Can I get a hug?

00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:12.640
Come on, man.

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:13.724
Wait, my drink…

00:48:14.225 --> 00:48:15.935
Got it. Come here.

00:48:46.632 --> 00:48:48.509
What are they filming?

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:50.136
Who is that?

00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:52.555
- Please step back.
- That's pretty cool.

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:54.807
What is it?

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:56.725
Isn't that Chae Seoyoung?

00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:59.603
Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.

00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:00.980
Sorry.

00:49:01.063 --> 00:49:03.482
- Chae Seoyoung is here.
- Can we take a picture?

00:49:03.566 --> 00:49:05.526
I don't know. For some movie, I guess.

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:08.529
What? Of course, you're way prettier.

00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:11.365
She's not that pretty at all.

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:16.412
Hang on a second.

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.876
Wow, she's gorgeous.

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.294
I've never seen her in real life.

00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:25.880
The dolly shot is gonna come right to you.

00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:28.466
Can't I just take one picture?

00:49:29.049 --> 00:49:30.050
No filming.

00:49:30.843 --> 00:49:32.928
- Why not?
- No photos, please.

00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:35.556
- Sorry.
- Can't I just take one?

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.141
- Scene 67, take 1.
- Action!

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.022
Cut!

00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:44.148
Action!

00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:47.276
Take 7!

00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:51.489
Let me wipe my sweat first.

00:49:56.202 --> 00:49:57.411
Cut!

00:49:58.454 --> 00:50:00.623
- Let's try one more time.
- Take 15.

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:02.541
Take 17.

00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:04.293
This better be the last take.

00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:42.456
TIME TO EAT

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.278
Cut! Okay!

00:51:14.363 --> 00:51:15.948
That last take was fantastic!

00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:18.534
I never thought it'd be this exhausting.

00:51:19.118 --> 00:51:20.878
I'm only doing this
because you're directing.

00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:22.955
Geez, I'm sorry.

00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:25.749
Speaking of, let's take a break
and do the next scene.

00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:28.669
The water might be a bit cold.

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.754
I checked, and it was all right.

00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:33.799
We got five outfits,
so you just need to go in five times.

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:42.266
Yeah.

00:51:43.726 --> 00:51:45.102
The car was stuffy,

00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.562
so I'm taking a breather.

00:51:47.813 --> 00:51:50.357
No, I'm fine. Don't come.
You guys go ahead and eat.

00:51:50.441 --> 00:51:52.651
I'll be back after getting some air.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.532
I'm hungry.

00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:02.036
Look, that's Chae Seoyoung.

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:03.329
What? For real?

00:52:03.871 --> 00:52:05.623
- Chae Seoyoung.
- Is that really her?

00:52:05.706 --> 00:52:06.999
Why is she here?

00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:10.586
What do I do…

00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:15.132
Um, excuse me.

00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:16.467
Take this if you need.

00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:19.219
Uh

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:20.846
I can't ruin my hair.

00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:21.930
But thank you.

00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:23.682
Oh, okay.

00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:52.336
Well, would you like a sandwich?

00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:55.089
I'm okay.

00:52:55.673 --> 00:52:57.758
Sorry to keep bothering you
while you're resting.

00:53:02.971 --> 00:53:04.723
Oh, this is rye bread.

00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:17.903
Are you Chae Seoyoung?
Could we take a picture with you?

00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:19.154
I'm such a huge fan.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.741
I'm sorry.

00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:24.993
She's eating right now.

00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:28.497
- Sorry. My apologies.
- Okay.

00:53:33.085 --> 00:53:34.086
Thank you.

00:53:35.504 --> 00:53:38.674
I just thought you needed some peace
for your break.

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:40.759
Am I being too nosy?

00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:47.516
Can I ask why you're filming with that?

00:53:49.935 --> 00:53:51.145
The scenery's pretty.

00:53:53.689 --> 00:53:56.984
I want to watch this later
in case I don't get to be here again.

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.987
Why won't you be here?
You can always come back.

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.823
I have to dive in there later.

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:03.907
Why?

00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:06.869
I'm being chased with a bag full of money,

00:54:06.952 --> 00:54:09.079
then I fight over it with the bag's owner

00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:10.664
until it drops in there.

00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:13.751
That's so awesome.

00:54:13.834 --> 00:54:15.210
It sounds really exciting.

00:54:15.294 --> 00:54:16.462
It's actually not.

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:18.839
I'm afraid of water.

00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:21.759
It feels like dying when I'm underwater.

00:54:26.805 --> 00:54:27.973
Sorry about that.

00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:31.518
But why, then?

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:33.353
Because it's my job.

00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:35.606
I have to endure it.

00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:39.860
Thanks for the food.

00:54:41.236 --> 00:54:42.237
I'm a big fan.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:45.866
Ever since <i>The Lonely People</i>.

00:54:46.658 --> 00:54:48.619
Ah, want an autograph?

00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:51.205
Or a photo, if you don't have a pen?

00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:56.126
If you don't mind, could we use this?
It has a selfie mode.

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.003
- Sure.
- Give me a second.

00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:06.970
I love you, Seoyoung!

00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:09.264
Thank you for the food.

00:55:09.348 --> 00:55:12.059
Wait, I forgot to press the button.

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.185
Hang on, sorry.

00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:14.728
There we go.

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.648
I love you, Seoyoung!

00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:19.399
Thanks for the food.

00:55:20.609 --> 00:55:21.902
Thank you so much.

00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:23.820
Thank you.

00:55:23.904 --> 00:55:25.739
I need to pay you back for the sandwich.

00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:27.908
It's okay. Go ahead.

00:55:29.868 --> 00:55:32.120
Thanks. If we ever meet again,

00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:33.997
I'll pay you back for the sandwich.

00:55:37.417 --> 00:55:39.211
Break a leg, Seoyoung!

00:55:39.795 --> 00:55:40.879
Good luck on the shoot!

00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:43.715
Break a leg!

00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.425
I love you!

00:55:46.552 --> 00:55:48.136
My gosh. Unbelievable.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.445
"LOVE IN WHITE" 6TH DRAFT
TERMINAL ILLNESS

00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:34.975
BU SEUNGWON

00:56:40.439 --> 00:56:43.525
I don't like the consultant you got me.
They didn't even read the synopsis.

00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:46.737
Can you at least say hello first?

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.864
How's it going? It's been a month.

00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.116
I told you two months.

00:56:51.199 --> 00:56:52.659
Was it the third draft last time?

00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.494
Now, that one was good.

00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:57.581
Was it the fifth?
It looks modern and ready to go.

00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:01.877
How can a female character
just be so submissive?

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.005
What would've happened
if the male protagonist didn't find her?

00:57:05.672 --> 00:57:07.466
<i>No dream, no ambition.</i>

00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:10.385
I don't know what the writer was thinking.

00:57:11.803 --> 00:57:14.348
Well, it's what your father was thinking.

00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:17.476
I don't know.

00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:19.144
What?

00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:22.356
I mean, it's way too old-fashioned
even for something from the 90s.

00:57:22.856 --> 00:57:23.940
<i>Old-fashioned?</i>

00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:26.985
Anyway, I got a new consultant for you.

00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:28.153
<i>You'll like this one.</i>

00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:30.322
<i>He's a very busy man, you know.</i>

00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:32.157
I worked really hard to fit you in.

00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:35.410
Okay, I'll humor you one more time.
Can I see him today?

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.121
Maybe the assistant director
wants to join?

00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:41.458
- I'll just go alone.
- <i>I'll send you the address.</i>

00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.210
Oh, and that doctor…

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:46.088
How should I put it?

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:47.339
<i>Well, he's a bit…</i>

00:57:47.422 --> 00:57:49.299
Never mind, you'll know when you see him.

00:57:49.883 --> 00:57:50.884
All right.

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.433
You're only 29,

00:57:58.517 --> 00:57:59.685
and you did <i>Squid Game</i>

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.895
and even <i>I, the Executioner</i>?

00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:05.482
Your résumé is seriously…

00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:07.317
Thank you so much.

00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.862
Are you okay, not getting any rest
after your last project?

00:58:10.946 --> 00:58:13.699
Well, this will be my last job as an AD.

00:58:13.782 --> 00:58:14.908
Of course!

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:18.078
Producers are lining up
for your directorial debut.

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.996
Why would I direct? It's such a hassle.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.083
It's exhausting. It's stressful.
Everyone wants everything from you.

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:26.378
You work in the cold when it's freezing,
in the heat when it's hot. Mm-mmm.

00:58:27.129 --> 00:58:28.380
I hate it.

00:58:28.463 --> 00:58:31.758
What? Then why are you still an AD?

00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:34.594
I wanted to work on Director Lee's film.

00:58:40.767 --> 00:58:42.644
That Bu Seungwon must be insane.

00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:44.813
How dare he try to throw her into that?

00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:48.483
Should I still run it by Seoyoung?

00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:49.776
Are you insane too?

00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:53.530
Just thinking about Lee Jeha
still makes my blood boil.

00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:56.742
All that time, money, and roles
Seoyoung lost because of him!

00:58:56.825 --> 00:58:57.951
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.496
Don't even say a word to Seoyoung.

00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:05.292
Keep this project away from her
no matter what.

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.543
Yes, ma'am.

00:59:06.626 --> 00:59:09.379
- Just shred it to pieces!
- I will.

00:59:18.764 --> 00:59:21.266
BE AS HAPPY AS YOU CHOOSE TO BE

00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:26.229
Here's your coffee.

00:59:28.148 --> 00:59:30.776
Have you ever been sick?

00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:34.529
I had a check-up a few years back.
Nothing extraordinary.

00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:36.823
What about your family, your parents?

00:59:40.494 --> 00:59:41.870
Both of my parents passed.

00:59:43.705 --> 00:59:44.873
Well, my mother…

00:59:45.874 --> 00:59:47.167
She was ill before she passed.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.376
Hmm.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.380
So your mother was ill.

00:59:54.216 --> 00:59:55.342
For now,

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:58.011
you asked about terminal cases
on your questionnaire.

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.889
Those can't be confirmed
through basic check-ups.

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:03.725
It just doesn't show up there. Never does.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:08.104
Then how do people
find out that they're sick?

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.315
Well,

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:12.859
they're usually carried in
when it's already too late.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:18.323
Oh. Usually.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:19.825
Mmm.

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:25.121
You know,
this whole "terminal illness" premise…

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.666
It's a bit cliché, I know. Way overused.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.126
Nah. It should be used more.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.004
Do you know how many terminal patients
there are in Korea?

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.091
A lot of them, and they're all different.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:39.469
It's a melodrama,
so we just need a simple terminal case.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.687
Now that's a cliché way of thinking.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.189
My man,

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:53.984
terminal cases are never simple.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:56.319
Right. Poor choice of words.

01:00:58.196 --> 01:00:59.281
I'm sorry.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.700
No need to apologize to me.

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:05.203
How long does the patient have?

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:07.622
You know, in your movie.

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:12.419
I'm a doctor who actually understands
dramatic license.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:15.672
How long would be appropriate?
That's what I came to ask.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.511
I think.

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:26.224
I want to be a director in my next life
instead of a doctor.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.144
You guys make up whatever you want.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.688
Love, death…

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:35.692
Well, yeah.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:39.571
How about a year?

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:43.867
Is that too long? Six months?

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.995
A year or six months, which is it?

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.455
You've got to make a choice.

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.790
That's a massive difference.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.084
Six months.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:54.210
Six months?

01:01:58.256 --> 01:01:59.507
Hmm.

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.137
Hang on. Let's see…

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.230
Hey, where are you?
You're still here, right?

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.690
Want to do some consulting?

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:17.859
Is that so?

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.028
Oh, I see.

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:23.990
Mmm.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.535
Dr. Lee probably doesn't know yet either.

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:28.828
I should head down too.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:31.373
All right.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.377
Follow me.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.098
<i>Cause of death was shock.</i>

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.017
<i>It happened just once,</i>

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.230
<i>but for this patient, that once was fatal.</i>

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.608
Excuse me.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:03.989
<i>That's why it ended so suddenly.</i>

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:07.742
That's why

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.120
illnesses are so scary.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.330
<i>You can't stop them,</i>

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.250
<i>you can't reverse them.
They happen so fast.</i>

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:19.671
<i>The shock episodes become more frequent
as the condition worsens.</i>

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:23.091
And yes, they're painful.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:24.634
Almost like getting shot.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:28.263
Like your whole body is torn apart.

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:33.018
Yes?

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.855
Ah. I'll head back up.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.357
They're calling for me.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:42.444
Wait here, and she'll be right over.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.988
Sorry? Who?

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.364
The one you're looking for.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:48.074
Carry on.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:58.668
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:45.340
THE LATE KIM MINJEONG

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:00.188
Minjeong…

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.053
TIME TO EAT

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:00.683
Hey.
Is there another doctor I can consult?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.602
This one's just a bit weird.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:03.811
Yes.

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:05.063
Is that so?

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:08.107
- Yes. All right.
- Hang on. I have to go.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:10.193
Yes, I understand.

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:12.070
What is it?

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:13.905
Hello.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:17.116
I'm not really sure how this works.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:21.788
I just wanted to ask if we can
use flowers other than chrysanthemums.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:25.208
Maybe something like ranunculus or lilies?

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:27.126
You know, like…

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.088
Something a bit more colorful and bright.

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.547
I don't know how to put it.

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:35.051
Kind of like wedding decorations, I guess?

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.470
And for the portrait area,

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:39.973
I was thinking
maybe alliums or baby's breath?

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.516
In the funeral hall?

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.143
Yes, the funeral hall.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:47.063
Actually, can we
change the location entirely?

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.315
I'd prefer it not be at a funeral home.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.359
Nothing too formal or traditional.

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.695
Is that even allowed?

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:56.239
That's what I'm asking. Is it?

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:00.410
Honestly, it's my first week on the job.
But I'll find out for you.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.161
Thank you.

01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:04.414
Could I just get your card?

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.377
FUNERAL DIRECTOR, KIM JIHO

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:18.344
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.337
Thank you.

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.127
Where have you been?

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:38.424
Me?

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.094
Yes, you.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.225
You were looking for me.

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.019
I was?

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:58.778
Are you the one
from the convenience store?

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:01.656
And also…

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:05.451
At Cinema Jongno, right?

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:09.622
We meet again.

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:17.088
Are you...

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:18.172
Yes.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.007
That's me too.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.016
I heard you needed a consultant.

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:35.022
Are you a doctor? Or a nurse?

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.569
Neither.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.468
I'm your consultant,

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.971
the terminal patient, Lee Daeum.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.517
I'm not looking to cast someone
in a documentary.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.310
Hello!

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.563
My name is Lee Daeum, and I'm an actress.

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.444
Try persuading Seoyoung
until production begins,

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.863
and if she says yes,
then the rookie can go.

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.700
I want to do that movie.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:11.994
I really want

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.331
to make this movie with you.
