00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:28.040
This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.160
I’m sorry.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.280
What you said was true.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.560
I forced you into fighting Typhoon.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.440
I won’t push you this time.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.240
Are you mad at me

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.200
It’s fine.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.080
If you had to force yourself to do it,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.240
It would’ve been worse.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.280
Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon will not be fighting...

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.040
He will be fighting...

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.040
with Typhoon Roaring Thunder.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.200
Then I guess your left hook isn’t heartless after all.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.720
Wanna find out if I’m truly heartless?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.200
(Typhoon)

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120
Do you like that?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920
I do.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.800
If you do, then take it off for me.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.280
(Typhoon)

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.800
Just answer it.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.440
(Typhoon)

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.400
(Are you practicing?)

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.600
Why did you call?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.960
I have something to ask.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.600
(This time you really want to fight me, right?)

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.480
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.120
(Congrats on finally letting go of me.)

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.480
If that's all you wanted to say, I’m hanging up.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.000
(I really have to beat you, Thun.)

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.720
The Fix

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.760
What’s going on between you and Typhoon?

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.680
In my life, he was all I had.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.600
Every time we trained,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.360
we always trained together.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.360
But I always held back.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.600
I never thought that doing that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.400
would make him think I was looking down on him.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.120
But Keen, it’s all in the past now.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240
Keen..

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.960
Thanks for sharing that.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.640
Rest up for tomorrow.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.560
Next weigh in is Thun, the Tiger-Taming Cannon

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.440
Keen.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.040
Hmm? You’re staring.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.800
Sorry, didn’t get much sleep last night.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.920
If Thun doesn’t make weight, I’m blaming you.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.560
For not fixing the scale.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.720
We had to go use the coin-operated one at the street corner.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.760
The one at the mall is still accurate.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.360
I’ll fix it.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.120
You all complain so much.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.280
162 pounds.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.000
He passed.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.640
Still gotta fix it, though.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.120
Next time we might not be so lucky.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.480
I’m thirsty. Want anything? I’ll grab it for you.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.320
I’m good.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.640
Then take Thun back to the rest room.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.520
I might take a while.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.480
Dad.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.960
Hey.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.440
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.920
Then who’s watching Thun?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.760
I came to get drinks.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.200
Keen’s watching Thun.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.120
One electrolyte, one water, and one Thai tea, please.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.960
But would Keen even know what to do?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.520
Come on, he’s done so much already.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.840
Also, one more green soda, please.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.840
This one too.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.360
Alright, I’ll go check on Thun first then.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.800
You catch up later.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.840
Go ahead, Dad. I still have something to do here.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.360
Wait.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.440
Here.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.480
Is this for Thun or for Keen?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.840
It's for you.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.800
You once said you liked green soda.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.240
Have a little sugar, you look tired.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.440
Thanks, bro.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.440
No worries.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.120
How much?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Here you go, no need for change.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.640
Water?

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.400
Sure.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.760
Oops, sorry.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.960
Want to try massaging me?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.400
Sure.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.680
Is that all the strength you’ve got?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.760
Harder.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.920
Deeper.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.120
More.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.960
More?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.720
Yeah.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.960
Is it usually this deep?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.960
Yeah.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.920
Keep going.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.960
Thun, here’s your electrolyte drink.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
What are you guys doing?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.120
Oh, I was massaging Thun.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.320
Here, I got you an electrolyte.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.600
You want to drink it now? I can keep massaging.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.200
No need, come give me a massage instead.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.640
Okay, then lie down.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.160
Don’t go all out in the early rounds today.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.200
Take it slow, conserve your energy.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.280
Push in round three or four.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.720
Got it?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.840
Yes, coach.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.840
I’m going to the bathroom.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.760
Hold it there.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.000
Just like that.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.240
Go, go!

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.240
Stop! Go to your corner!

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.640
Blue! Blue!

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:34.680
Yeah!!

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.280
Thun vs. Typhoon!

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.640
You betting on Thun?

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.680
Of course, he’s from our gym!

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.680
He knocked out Typhoon in the last round.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.480
No way he loses this one.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
Well, if you’re that confident,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.440
I’m putting down a big bet.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.080
Hope you’re not throwing your money away.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.320
Pakorn likes to bribe the judges.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.440
Nonsense, man.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.440
This time we’re getting a KO for sure.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.400
Just wait and see.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.640
Hey bro, can I up my dose?

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.520
I can’t afford to lose this time.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.480
If I lose to the same guy twice…

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.480
My future’s over.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.000
But you know, once the drug wears off, it hurts.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.320
The higher the dose,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.160
the more it hurts.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.520
And it’s bad for your health in the long run.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.160
I know it only lasts 12 hours.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.840
Please, man.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.520
( Yeah?)

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.880
Don’t tell Mr.Pakorn, I’m begging you.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.520
Alright.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.680
Hey!

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.240
Hey, hi Uncle Petch.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.080
Hello.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.440
You didn’t say you were coming.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.000
Better late than never.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.760
Come on, I’ve got work, you know.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.840
Hey, but I made it in time for the previous match.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.040
The blue corner got punched so bad their face was a mess.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.280
Still won by points.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.000
I bet the judges were bribed.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
What do you mean by bribed?

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.120
Huh? I’ll explain.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.640
It’s pressure on the judges to favor certain fighters.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.520
Keen,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.120
come inside first, we’ll talk there.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.040
Pressure on the referees from big bettors.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.280
You go ahead, Uncle Petch is waiting.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.000
See you.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Sure.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.520
Hey, there’s Keen and Bung!

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.640
Over there!
Oh,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.360
you’re here too?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.760
Hi!
Hi!

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.840
Wanna sit with us?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.120
Come on, let’s go.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.440
Welcome to the Redemption Fight Night!

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.040
Yeah!!

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.480
If you’re ready, the wait is over!

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.320
Give a big round of applause and cheer for our blue corner:

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:23.200
Thun, the Tiger-Taming Cannon from Petchsak Academy!

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.880
Known as the Heartless Left Hook!

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.320
Let’s see how heartless he really is.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.720
Last time, Thun won by knockout.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.120
Will tonight be the same or different?

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.280
And now, for the red corner, let’s hear it for

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:51.920
Typhoon Roaring Thunder from P. White Tiger Academy!

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.840
(Typhoon!)

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.000
Weighing 165 pounds,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.600
standing 185 cm tall, 24 years old.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.520
He’s here to settle the score.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.280
Let’s see if he can turn the tables tonight.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.120
Give it up one more time!

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.080
You got this!

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.440
The Cannon can really tame the Tiger, right?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.160
Thun, don’t underestimate him.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.840
He’s got punches too. Keep your hands up!

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.280
Stay focused! Let’s go.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.280
To the blue corner.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.960
Round one—fight!

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.960
Go get him, Thun!

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.120
Come on, Thun!

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.480
Good!

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
Don't lose focus.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.360
Back to your corner!

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.400
Red, go! Red! Two times—who’s got it?

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.680
Cannon! Cannon!

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.960
Take your mouthguard out.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.560
You got this, Thun!

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.560
You’re doing good, Thun.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.160
Keep your hands up. Don’t get careless.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.640
Don’t let emotions take over, got it?

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.640
Just keep those hands up.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.040
He’s tougher this time.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.960
But good job, good job.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.440
Go Thun!

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.240
Here he comes!

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.160
Fifty thousand baht bonus for blue corner!

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.760
Yeah!!

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.720
Don't lose focus.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.520
Thun, be careful.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.800
Separate, separate!

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.800
Listen to the referee!

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.680
Thun, be careful.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.560
Thun, fight!

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.960
Come on, P’Thun, give it your all!

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.680
Hang in there, Thun!

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.360
One more round and you've won.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.240
(I really have to win this time.)

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.480
Fight!

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.400
Keep fighting, Thun!

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.800
Thun, move out.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.360
Come on.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.200
Come on!

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.040
Come on!

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.720
Come on.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.400
Come on!

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.560
Come on!

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.240
Come on!

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.760
It’s done, it’s done.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.760
Cannon!

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760
Who’s got it?

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:09.520
Cannon!

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:29.120
Cannon!

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.720
What the hell kind of decision is that?

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.280
We clearly won by a mile.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.520
I told you, this time wouldn’t be like before.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.600
This time luck really isn’t on your side.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.520
I told you guys, Pakorn…

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.120
he’d never let his boy lose for the second round, ha!

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.800
Those judges seriously don’t know what they’re doing?

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.560
Thun threw way more punches.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.040
Ugh…

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.480
Damn it, he had to win!

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.680
Let it go, bro.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.080
Shit, my money's gone, damn it!

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.200
Weren’t you betting at Mr. Thep’s table?

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.840
No need to stress, Mr. Thep’s easygoing.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.800
Damn it all.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.640
Screw this.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.360
You really wanted to win that bad, huh?

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.160
Huh?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.800
It’s obvious the judges were biased.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.280
Thun landed so many blows, how could he lose?

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.520
The blood on your face says it all.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.160
Good you came.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.480
The event’s yours, the boxer’s yours too.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.000
And the judges—yours too, right?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.880
Keen.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.120
Cannon.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.880
Typhoon, head back to your room first.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.200
Yes, sir.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.960
The judge’s decision is final.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.960
Have some respect.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.360
Take Thun to the interview backdrop now.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.760
What do you think caused you to lose this match?

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.880
It’s normal.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.520
Maybe I really was undertrained.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.280
Guess we’re even now.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.600
But most people think the result was fixed for Typhoon to beat Cannon.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.880
What’s your take on that?

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.320
Is it true?

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.480
Whatever the case, I respect the judge’s decision.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.480
It was still a really great match,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.480
even though I lost.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.920
Can we get a photo, please?

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.280
Over here, please.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.280
And here too.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.280
Thank you.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.240
I think this time was just way too much.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.920
It was clear Thun won.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.080
The judges were Pakorn’s people.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.520
Probably just like they said, politics at play.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.800
What are you looking at?

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.880
Nothing.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.120
You really live up to your nickname, heartless.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.640
Don’t you feel anything at all?

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.920
What kind of emotion do you want from me?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.840
I’m hungry, does that count?

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.560
Let’s go.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.160
Sorry I was a bit moody today.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.840
I just can’t stop wondering how you lost.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.560
I get it.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.200
That’s boxing,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.520
gambling’s always in the mix.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.280
But are we really going to let it stay this way forever?

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.000
Feels like we're on a date.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.080
What date?

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.520
It’s just the two of us in the restaurant.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.560
Kinda romantic, right?

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.160
Why are you smiling?

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200
Nothing.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.600
Just never seen Cannon Tiger Tamer grin this wide before.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.400
We should’ve invited Mai to join us.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.040
He’s been whining about wanting to eat outside of the academy for ages.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.320
Come to think of it, this is our first time eating alone together.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.600
We’ll probably end up doing it often.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.640
Whoa.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.640
You like it?

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.360
Mm-hmm.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400
I do.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.640
You like this one?

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.560
Excuse me?

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.960
Is there any way I could get that plushie without playing the game?

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.200
Oh, if you want that one,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.400
then go punch that machine over there.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.360
If you score high enough, it’s yours.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.760
Hey, no need—I’ll do it.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.600
Hold this.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.560
Hey.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.400
You gotta throw your whole body into the punch like this.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.760
Make a fist.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.120
Then swing your whole body like this.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.880
Give it a try.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.240
Did that hurt?

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.960
Blow on it for me.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.000
Blow on it?

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.000
Whoa, pain’s gone!

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
A bit dramatic?

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.280
Okay, okay—my turn.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.640
Thanks.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.400
Here.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.760
Even though I lost today,

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.840
I’m really happy.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.280
What about you, Keen?

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.840
I am really happy.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200
Your faces match now.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.160
Hello?

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.600
What time?

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.440
(Morning’s fine.)

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.360
Okay, got it.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.640
What happened?

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.040
That was the flat owner.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.440
I’ve got to clear my stuff out tomorrow.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.160
I’ll come help.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.480
Thanks.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.120
Whoa, this new hospital is so pretty!

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.520
I’m glad you like it.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.440
You’re going to get stronger now that we moved hospitals.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.960
I’m already strong!

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.360
That’s great! Get well soon, Keaw.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.720
Okay!

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.120
Excuse me.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.040
Yes?

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.240
Your little sister is really lucky,

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.240
such a kind person helping out.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.840
Can you sign here for the treatment consent?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.400
Here you go.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.720
Thank you.
Thanks.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.120
So? You like it?

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:07.800
I do!

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.480
They even have cartoons for you to watch too.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.160
Thanks for coming with me today.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200
Of course.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.160
Ait.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.880
Can I ask you something?

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.600
Yeah?

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.160
Will you keep working massage jobs,

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.520
now that you don’t have to pay for Keaw’s treatment anymore?

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.120
Why do you ask?

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.360
Well, now that Keaw’s getting her new heart…

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.440
I was hoping you’d stop.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.680
I’ll take care of you.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.720
Is that okay?

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.360
Yeah.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.800
I’ll quit.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.560
From now on, I’ll finally get to be a full-time boxer.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.480
Well, well!

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.720
Heard you lost?

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.480
I just paid the last one off, why are you here again?

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.960
I’m not here to collect money, just passing by.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.360
Thought I’d drop in.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.240
So what do you want?

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.720
Jealous?

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.480
Anyway, thanks for paying it all off.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.840
Your man is really something.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.760
So impressive.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.920
Ooh!

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.000
You smell so good.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:25.960
Sa.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.480
Yes?

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.880
Whose debt next?

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.480
That one, same as before.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.720
Okay.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.480
You shouldn’t have paid my debt.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.200
It wasn’t your responsibility.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.920
But I wanted to help you.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.400
You really like to do things without telling me, huh?

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.160
If I told you, you wouldn’t have let me.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.680
Sorry, I didn’t say anything.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.240
But, Keen..

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.320
I just wanted to do something for you.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.640
I’m sorry.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.000
But I’ll pay you back when I can.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.600
From now on, you’re debt-free.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.920
Do you still want to stay at the academy?

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.120
Do you want me to stay?

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.480
Yes.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.160
Stay with me, Keen.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.080
So…

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.880
do you want a boxer as your boyfriend?

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.600
Do you?

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.680
Tell me.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.440
There's too much dust.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.720
You, should we change the way we call each other?

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.880
Do you want to?

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.960
Well, we’ve changed our relationship status,

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.960
so we should change how we address each other too.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.560
Darling.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.240
Right now, we’re together quietly like this. Are we really just going to let it slide?

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.040
Once we start… there’s no going back.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.800
(Squeals)

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.120
What’s up, Mawin?

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.760
Didn’t you say you’d earn money from boxing to pay back Sia Thep?

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.080
Where’s my money!

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.360
Hey! What the hell are you guys doing?

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.240
If you don’t get it within a month…

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.560
you know what’s going to happen.
