OUR MOVIE

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.199
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.701
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:35.953
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.080
Can't you tell cheap pity from love?

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.165
Not here. Let's talk outside.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:41.375
No, you talk.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.503
How could you even think to fall in love
when you're dying?

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.575
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK TO FALL
IN LOVE WHEN YOU'RE DYING?

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:30.257
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK TO FALL
IN LOVE WHEN YOU'RE DYING?

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.725
EPISODE 8

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:41.560
Ms. Chae…

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.771
…I'm terminally ill.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.025
Daeum.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.193
This isn't acting, it's not for show.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.154
I'm actually a dying terminal patient.

00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:58.577
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:00.662
I couldn't keep our promise.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.124
I just can't keep lying to her anymore.

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:13.634
A terminal patient?

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:16.970
I'm sorry, Ms. Chae.

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:22.184
Is this all true?

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.353
Let's talk, you and I.

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:36.615
This is worse than I even imagined.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:42.704
I can't stay here.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.253
Daeum.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:55.342
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.679
It's raining, so don't go out.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.555
Stay here.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:34.798
Let's talk.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.800
Why?

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.219
Why did you follow me?

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.346
Trying to shut me up?

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.724
Is it enough just for me to keep quiet?

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.226
You call yourself human?

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.728
Yes, Daeum's sick. And…

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.441
…she might really die soon too.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.113
That's why I needed her.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:03:59.698
What?

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.577
You know why I can never
be all-in on this movie.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:06.788
But Daeum?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.500
She's genuinely devoted to Gyuwon.
So I figured even if I mess it up,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.920
she'd be the one to complete this movie.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.256
Lee Jeha.

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:18.258
You're insane.

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:20.927
I'm sick and tired

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.473
of being the only one stuck in place.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.475
You, Seungwon, Jungwoo.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.394
Everyone I worked with
all moved forward in the last five years.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.147
Only I was still right where I'd been.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.444
So I grabbed on to a dying girl

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.070
and my father's movie

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.240
just so I could find a way out.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.286
You should've stayed
where you were and rotted.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.454
I know.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.290
I should've done that.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.919
I'm sorry.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.003
Forget it.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.380
You've got two options now.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.467
Make things right,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.346
or keep lying to everyone
and drag this whole thing down with you.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.599
Either way, don't expect my support.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.979
I know I can't turn things back.

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.690
But I want to make this movie with Daeum.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.486
She really doesn't have much time.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.030
A terminal patient.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.744
You're seriously filming with a girl
who could die at any moment?

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.579
What if she really dies?

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.290
That means you're done too!

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.377
If I can just finish this movie,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.755
I don't care if I never get another chance

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.590
or if people think I'm inhumane.

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.135
None of that really matters anymore.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.265
You should've made a deal,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.101
not come begging.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:57.148
If you cast her knowing the risk
that she could die mid-shoot,

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.608
and I found out?

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.027
You should've told me, "You want the role?

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.905
No? Then tell me what you actually want."

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.867
It's not the movie
you're trying to protect.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.411
You're trying to protect Daeum.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.543
I'll think about what to do
with what I know.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:20.005
Me? I can just expose everything
and walk away.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:24.050
I have no interest
in staying quiet about any of this.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:25.927
However,

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.014
if it's a deal, I'll consider it.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.935
I can see you have feelings for her.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.814
But why does that seem so pathetic to me?

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:42.277
Can someone like you give everything up
and love someone?

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.739
Even knowing it's going to end?
Can you really?

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.456
<i>Would you like a sandwich?</i>

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.083
I love you, Seoyoung!

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.751
Thanks for the food.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.670
Let's rehearse together here.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.797
I'll be here whenever you want.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.258
That's how I'll repay you
for the sandwich.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.867
Thank you,

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.787
for keeping me alive today.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.880
After shooting nothing but car chases
and exploding buildings all day,

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:10.300
slowing down to watch
someone else's sappy love story…

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.969
feels great.

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.263
Really? I find it awfully hard.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:17.390
It's hard, sure.
But it's got its own charm.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.934
You look at their love

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.686
and rethink your own.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:26.232
So how do you tell what is or isn't love?

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.485
How could you not tell?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.653
Does everyone know how to tell that?

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.447
You really can't tell?

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.408
Or are you the type
who's scared to admit it?

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.829
It's not that he can't admit it,
maybe he's confused.

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:43.041
Real love is rare these days,
you hardly see it.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.669
Make one wrong call
and your whole life is ruined.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.880
If you build a wall around your heart,

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:52.133
love can try to knock it down
and you still won't recognize it.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.761
It's sad but happens all the time.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.055
Sad? I'd call it caution.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:10:00.850
It's just immature to pour your heart out
to anything that feels like love.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.977
When it's blurry,
you need to use good judgment.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.979
And how do you do that?

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.898
Ah. Most of the time,

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.901
if you're wondering
whether it's love or not,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.903
chances are it's already begun.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.822
Mm-mmm.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.449
Or it usually fades out in confusion.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.661
Maybe it's a matter of courage.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.997
What's courage got to do with it?

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:27.377
- Uh, if you're too defensive…
- Mmm.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.046
…you won't even notice love
when it's there.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:32.465
Gosh.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.800
Wow, that looks good.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.803
We get two days off after today's shoot.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:37.971
Are you heading to Seoul?

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.765
Yes, I need to see my dermatologist.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.559
Should we go to the hospital first, then?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.146
Uh… No, I have a friend who goes with me.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.939
The one you live with? Gyoyeong?

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:51.025
- Yes.
- Hang on. Let me check my calendar.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.071
Let's see. Huh?

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.156
JEHA'S MOTHER'S MEMORIAL DAY

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:59.159
I should ask if Jeha…
I mean, Mr. Lee's going too.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.163
Tomorrow's his mother's memorial day,

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.373
so I should drive him if he's too tired.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.251
Wait, I should've run that by you first.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.628
Oh. No, of course, you should.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.839
He has to come with us.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:15.008
I'll tell him later myself.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:33.735
That worked, right?

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.696
Yes, the emotion was there.
We'll use that take.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.364
<i>Okay. See you later, Mr. Lee.</i>

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.785
Hong, we're good here.
Let's move on to the bookstore.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.078
Start setting it up.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.205
Sure.

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:47.707
Hello.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.627
- Hello, Mr. Ji.
- Hello.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.170
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:54.964
Eunho.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.801
It'll take at least
half an hour to set up.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.011
Why are you out so early?

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.304
I wanted to rehearse.

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:04.515
And getting to see the crew lug around
these big pieces of equipment…

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.101
The whole commotion fascinates me.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.854
Then do you want to watch me set up
while you rehearse?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.439
Sounds good.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.026
The DP says speed's the key to this shoot,

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.362
so he's been drilling us on fast setups.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.405
I see.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.492
We get two days off starting tomorrow.
Heading to Seoul?

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.620
Yeah. I'm going for a day,
and spending another here.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.373
- Then I guess I'm staying too.
- Hmm?

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.125
Hang out with me. What do you say?

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.336
I'll stay here and wait for you.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.006
- Mr. Ji.
- Okay.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.239
What are you doing here?

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.241
Just enjoying the scenery.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.826
Meeting with the director?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.661
Go on.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.879
Wow. Mr. Lee!

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.923
The ocean's so pretty here.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.927
I love it.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.273
Are you heading to Seoul tomorrow?

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:37.525
I've been meaning to tell you.

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:38.609
Let's go together.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.489
Junbyung said we should go together

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.283
because you looked tired.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.286
Why is he being nosy all of a sudden?

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:52.623
You're supposed to get a checkup
at the hospital. You can't go with him.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.086
I'll just tell him

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.131
that I'll take you on my way there.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.386
The lies just keep piling up.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.847
I'm sorry.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.225
For piling up more lies.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:14.520
If that's what we need to do, then we lie.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:17.607
We can't afford to fall apart
from guilt right now.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.530
Aren't we in this together,

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:25.865
bound by a contract?

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:32.497
<i>Mr. Lee?</i>

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.544
Yeah, what is it?

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:39.670
<i>Need something to drink?</i>

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.131
Anything's fine.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.635
Let's go.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.558
Mr. Lee!

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.814
What do you mean "anything"?
That didn't help.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.357
Hmm?

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.944
- Thanks for this, Daeum.
- Pardon?

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:06.781
Your manager was milking that coffee truck
for all its worth.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:08.324
But why did you thank me?

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:12.036
There's a super fancy coffee truck
with your name plastered all over it.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.996
Did you sign with an agency?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.124
Hmm. Good for you.

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:21.003
TAKE CARE OF DAEUM'S GYUWON
WARM WISHES TO THE CAST AND CREW

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.589
- Here's your order.
- Great, thank you.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.217
- Thank you.
- The straws are right next to you.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.927
- Okay.
- I love this.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.137
So chewy.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.986
TAKE CARE OF DAEUM'S GYUWON

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.946
Oh.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.157
- Was it you?
- Wow, there were so many options.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.075
I heard that's
the highest-tier coffee truck.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.160
Here, try it.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.454
Did you arrange all of this?

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.291
- Thank you.
- Huh?

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.334
It's good.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.753
Surprise!

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.214
Wow, Daeum.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.133
Treating the whole crew?

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.885
That's our leading lady. Hmm?

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:10.636
Ah…

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.805
Did you arrange this, Ms. Go?

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.725
I should grab one too.

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.602
Oh, what would you like?
Something hot?

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:20.146
- Come on, it's always iced for me.
- One iced please.

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:22.899
All right, they're still setting up,

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.026
so let's have some milk tea.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.986
Hey, Jaein! Have some of this.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:31.991
It's been a while, Jaein.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.493
Hello, Ms. Go.

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:38.039
It's like you know every actor out there.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.207
You two are acquainted?

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.541
Mm-hmm.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.878
I felt we were cut from the same cloth,
so we had a quick chat.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:46.589
Didn't we?

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.342
Ms. Go and Jaein…

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.636
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.471
I guess you are similar.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:00.144
It's not easy doing all this

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.188
for someone who's not even signed
with your agency.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.981
I guess you're hoping

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.234
the third time's the charm.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.360
Third time? Please.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:10.696
She didn't even give me three seconds.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.701
As you can see, I already have a manager.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:18.871
He knows me well
and takes very good care of me.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.916
My manager's all I need at this moment.

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:23.084
Are you sure?

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.254
Or did the director
gaslight you into thinking so?

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.799
Come on, Ms. Go. I'm not that gullible.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:33.719
- Thank you for the drinks.
- Please enjoy, Daeum.

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.097
Have some more.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:40.935
This is really good.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.358
Hey, you two. Come over here.

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:48.859
Here you go.

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.362
You too, Seoyoung.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.616
TAKE CARE OF DAEUM'S GYUWON
WARM WISHES TO THE CAST AND CREW

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.289
Thanks for this, Daeum.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:06.794
Must be uncomfortable though,

00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:08.671
getting support you didn't ask for.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.090
For now, maybe.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.258
But you never know.

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:14.552
She might end up joining us.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.348
And maybe you, Seoyoung, might end up
wanting my support again.

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:22.935
Shall we head back to set?

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.188
It's exciting, the first scene
with all three of you.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:27.273
Let's go.

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.275
Shall we?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.445
Can't you tell cheap pity from love?

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.238
Not here. Let's talk outside.

00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:36.824
No, you talk.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.452
How could you even think

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.704
to fall in love when you're dying?

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.549
Yes, that's good. Let's go like that.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.722
This line is too cruel.

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:11.651
<i>Can't you tell cheap pity from love?</i>

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:13.819
<i>Not here. Let's talk outside.</i>

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.490
No, you talk.

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:20.534
How could you even think to fall in love
when you're dying?

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:29.585
<i>Why not?</i>

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:35.216
I can love harder, more truly.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.720
What could you possibly do
with so little time?

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.305
Anything I can.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.934
Whether it's love

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.227
or a proper goodbye.

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.480
<i>That's selfish.</i>

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.316
Something only the one leaving would say.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.281
- Cut.
- That's a cut!

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.038
Give me a moment.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:16.340
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.375
Mr. Lee, it's Seoyoung.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.796
She wants to talk to you.
I think you should go.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.274
Got a call from Seoyoung.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:40.132
That wasn't Gyuwon and Junghwa in there.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.051
That was Lee Daeum and Chae Seoyoung.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.762
I used Junghwa's voice
to say what I wanted to say.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:47.264
That was a cruel thing to say to Daeum

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:50.100
and wasn't professional of me.

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:54.230
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.148
I get it.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.069
It's like that time.

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:02.863
Back when we did <i>The Lonely People.</i>

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:06.367
When I hid in the bathroom
because I couldn't go on,

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.994
you came to get me just like now.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:17.962
Let's keep it calm.

00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:22.508
When I smile, when I look blank,
when I look nervous. You keep saying no.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.762
This is a secret, but I'm making this film
because I don't really know.

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:30.099
Don't know what?

00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:32.518
What it's like to love someone.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.520
<i>You said</i>
<i>you didn't know back then.</i>

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.647
Do you know now?

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:39.650
I think I might.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:44.905
That was good just now.
I'm going to keep your improvised lines.

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.742
I know this is hard for you as an actor.

00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:50.828
As your director, I do feel sorry.

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.623
As an actor?

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:56.500
As a director?

00:23:00.004 --> 00:23:01.297
Look at you, drawing lines.

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:02.923
How shameless.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.968
This is our workplace, after all.

00:23:15.853 --> 00:23:18.439
Seoyoung. Are you feeling okay?

00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:19.523
Yes, I'm fine.

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:26.864
Rest up a bit.

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:37.082
Might be hard to reshoot from the top
because of labor hour issues.

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:39.793
We'll go with the last take
and wrap up here.

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:42.254
Really? We'll call it a day?

00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:43.339
Yeah.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.133
Ms. Yu, the last cut's a go.

00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:48.636
<i>Please strike the set.</i>
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:49.887
Oh, we're good to go.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.221
Okay, then!

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:54.433
- Great work, everyone.
- Well done.

00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:00.648
If you keep killing it like this,
I won't want to let you go.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.193
We're going with that take!
Thank you, everyone!

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.279
- Great job!
- Good work, everyone.

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:15.537
Are you okay?

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.209
Not now. Let's talk later.

00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:24.171
First week of shooting
and there's already been an incident.

00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:26.632
What? That wasn't an incident.

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:30.052
Spare a little attention for Seoyoung too.

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.221
You've been too focused on Daeum.

00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:36.350
And it's not just me who thinks that.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.227
Hey, director.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.813
Stay balanced, okay?

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:42.815
Okay?

00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:46.276
Whatever, let's get a drink.

00:24:47.528 --> 00:24:48.821
Come on, let's go.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.002
I said, let's talk later.

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.716
I have something to say, Ms. Chae.

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:22.354
I'm sorry.

00:25:24.273 --> 00:25:26.358
I blurted out that line
without discussing first.

00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.486
You must've been thrown off.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:32.740
It felt real.

00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:36.035
I picked up on it,
and the emotion just flowed.

00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:40.289
The director okayed it,
so don't stress over it.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.169
I woke up this morning…

00:25:48.422 --> 00:25:50.340
and realized I was still alive.

00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.553
For someone like me,
waking up at all is a miracle.

00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:57.639
Then I thought, am I asking too much?

00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:01.685
Is it right to do all this
when it makes people uncomfortable?

00:26:02.186 --> 00:26:05.522
And then, Junghwa's line really hit me.

00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:06.607
So…

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.942
It's not just you. I do that too.

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.571
I'm not sure
if it's me or Junghwa talking.

00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:15.574
Or if what we're doing here is even right.

00:26:17.367 --> 00:26:18.368
Hmm.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.122
Both Gyuwon and I

00:26:23.165 --> 00:26:24.958
are terminally ill patients.

00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:29.379
But we're both still alive.

00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:33.592
You know, Ms. Chae…

00:26:34.218 --> 00:26:36.678
I really want to be in this movie.

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:39.890
Yeah, I understand that.

00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:42.267
No, you don't understand.

00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.103
Uh…

00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:47.314
Every night, I beg to live.

00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:49.358
And when I wake up,

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.610
I think, "Wow, I got one more day."

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:53.362
"Wait, no."

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:56.240
"Maybe today's the last."

00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:58.200
You have to know

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:01.829
I've put everything on the line for this.

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:03.872
All the time I have left.

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:05.916
So what do you want me to do?

00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:10.003
Shut up and pretend I don't know?

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.881
I know it sounds selfish,

00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:16.718
but I want to ask you
to pretend like you don't know.

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:19.388
At least you're honest.

00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:22.182
Okay, then.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.018
Let me be honest with you too.

00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:27.354
If you're only thinking about yourself,

00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:29.982
then so will I.

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:37.281
Wow.

00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:40.909
Just take a glass. Hmm.

00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:52.754
Mmm.

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.548
This is good. Try it.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.847
That's sweet. Hmm?

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.056
Let me try some.

00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:08.312
Mmm.

00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:11.690
Man, that's a perfect pairing.

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:12.858
Just like you and me.

00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:16.403
What do you want to get out of this film?

00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:21.199
Did you drink the <i>makgeolli</i>?
Why, all of a sudden?

00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:25.412
You know, just curious.

00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:31.168
Bu Seungwon's got the Midas touch.

00:28:31.251 --> 00:28:33.587
Everything I get involved in makes money.

00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:35.881
Is that really what matters?

00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:38.467
We're talking about
people's livelihoods here.

00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:40.886
I'm responsible for that too.

00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.640
That applies to me too.

00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:47.935
Oh, please.

00:28:48.518 --> 00:28:50.646
Directors shouldn't stress about that.

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:52.731
What do you want out of it?

00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:55.275
That you can do it without your dad?

00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:01.198
Not sure. Now that I'm actually
making this film, I keep forgetting

00:29:02.199 --> 00:29:04.409
who Lee Duyoung was to me,

00:29:04.493 --> 00:29:05.619
and…

00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:08.497
whether that even mattered to me
in the first place.

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:12.793
You've changed a bit lately.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.671
No.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:18.590
It's like you want to change.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.010
I don't know
if I'm someone who can change.

00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:24.471
Everyone can change.

00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:27.724
Hopefully your change
brings a box office hit, huh?

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:38.110
Daeum!

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:40.862
Our leading lady.

00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:44.658
Are you heading in now?

00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:47.786
We're going in for another round.
Want to join us?

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:52.249
I must be drunk already. My head hurts.

00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:56.670
Wait, were you even a drinker?

00:29:57.254 --> 00:29:58.588
Oh…

00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:01.925
I got drunk on the vibes,
so to speak.

00:30:02.426 --> 00:30:04.886
Uh, I need to walk it off a bit.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.221
Have a good night.

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.931
I'll see you later.

00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:09.016
All right.

00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:14.021
You think they have <i>makgeolli</i> in there?

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.791
Was that loud entrance necessary?

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:42.841
You've also caused quite the scene on set.

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:46.219
Maybe that's partly your fault.

00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:49.056
You seemed a little upset earlier.

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.141
Not upset.

00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:53.643
Just embarrassed.

00:30:53.727 --> 00:30:54.936
Mmm.

00:30:58.148 --> 00:30:59.900
I came to see Daeum, sure.

00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:02.194
But I also wanted to talk to you.

00:31:07.824 --> 00:31:08.825
About what?

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:11.286
The contract. What's your decision?

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:12.704
Do you even need me?

00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:14.039
Of course, I do.

00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:15.415
I don't need you.

00:31:15.499 --> 00:31:16.708
Negotiation's off.

00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:19.002
Please leave so I can rest.

00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.505
Then what do you need?

00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:24.091
Tell me. Let me hear it.

00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:30.806
I've got scripts
from all the hottest directors.

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:31.890
Don't need those either?

00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:43.985
Sincerity.

00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:45.070
What?

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:49.116
I'm not asking
for something you don't have.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.119
We weren't always like this.

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.247
What happened to us?

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:58.416
Get some rest.

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:19.187
Why are you following me?

00:32:20.397 --> 00:32:21.565
It's not safe out here.

00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:24.860
- There are wild dogs and all.
- Mmm.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.112
Perfect, then.

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:28.780
Want to go for a walk with me?

00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:30.365
There's a lighthouse over there.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.659
That's not a good idea.

00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:34.119
You shouldn't walk that long.

00:32:36.204 --> 00:32:37.873
Then how about sitting for long?

00:32:44.337 --> 00:32:47.048
I don't think anyone from our crew
will show up here.

00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:49.092
Right?

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:56.808
Are you cold? Let's head back in.

00:32:56.892 --> 00:32:58.727
No, it's not that.

00:32:59.853 --> 00:33:01.688
Why do I feel so uncomfortable?

00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:04.774
You know what? Okay.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.069
There.

00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:09.779
That's good.

00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:13.992
- What are you doing?
- I want to hear the waves,

00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:15.869
look at the stars,

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.206
and see your face too.

00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:38.725
Last night,

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:41.770
why did you just stand there like a fool?

00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:45.565
"Some crazy terminal patient
followed me around

00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:47.525
and kept begging me."

00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:49.778
"She put her life on the line,

00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:52.781
so I just gave in."

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.282
You could've just said that.

00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:01.539
I have some unresolved stuff
with Seoyoung.

00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.291
It wasn't about you.

00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:05.877
My own mess…

00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:10.715
ended up hurting you.

00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:16.888
Mr. Lee.

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:24.646
It's our mess, isn't it?

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:27.315
There's no your mess
or my mess between us.

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:28.817
We're in this together,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.527
bound tightly by a contract.

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:39.536
I don't exactly know what happened

00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.038
between you and Seoyoung…

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:46.001
but don't beat yourself up too much.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.672
Why do you keep worrying about me?

00:34:51.256 --> 00:34:52.549
Because I like you.

00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:58.138
You just worry about yourself.

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:01.057
Why do you keep worrying about me?

00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:17.282
Gosh.

00:35:18.408 --> 00:35:19.576
It's getting cold.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.661
Shall we head back in?

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:34.799
MS. GO HYEYOUNG

00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:51.733
Give these to Daeum for me.

00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:54.903
You two seemed especially close.

00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.906
Okay, I'll pass these on.

00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:01.743
Sorry for the late hour.
I'm driving back up now.

00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:04.371
All right, have a safe trip.

00:36:06.748 --> 00:36:08.124
Are you dating Daeum?

00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:11.920
That kind of question

00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:14.089
is a bit out of line.

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:15.924
Well, I've been burned once

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.217
by you before.

00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:19.761
Whatever you have with Daeum,

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:22.555
just don't mess with Seoyoung.

00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:25.350
Even if Seoyoung's the one hung up on you,

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.143
at least don't hurt her

00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:29.479
like you did last time.

00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:43.576
Junbyung.

00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:46.287
Hey. Should I tell Daeum to come down?

00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:50.125
Actually, I'll drive her.

00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:51.835
Why?

00:36:51.918 --> 00:36:55.338
I'm heading up anyway.
No need for both of us to go.

00:36:57.799 --> 00:36:59.050
You can just rest here.

00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:01.594
But you must be exhausted
from shooting nonstop.

00:37:01.678 --> 00:37:02.971
And you don't even like driving.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:05.432
I do like driving, and I'm not exhausted.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.814
You've always hated driving.

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.233
When you start liking things
you normally hate

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:18.111
and don't even get tired,

00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:19.946
that could be, you know…

00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:21.990
You know what people say.

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:25.410
Love.

00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:41.760
Just anything black is fine.

00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:43.428
"Anything black" isn't a thing.

00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:46.639
How can a cinematographer
have so little aesthetic sense?

00:37:46.723 --> 00:37:48.683
Black comes in all kinds of tones.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.103
Why are you so aggressive?

00:37:57.484 --> 00:37:58.485
Try this on.

00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:01.237
Uh, if it's XL, it'll fit.

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:04.324
Why are you coasting through life?

00:38:04.407 --> 00:38:05.992
For coats like this,

00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:08.077
the fit makes all the difference.

00:38:17.212 --> 00:38:18.296
Come over here.

00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:19.380
Oh, okay.

00:38:20.173 --> 00:38:21.633
Put your arms in.

00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:27.806
Hey, this looks nice.

00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:29.766
Yeah. It's nice.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.101
Makes you look handsome.

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:33.186
Sorry?

00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:36.898
You know, clothes make the man.

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.066
Ah.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:41.027
This is good. Much better.
Let's get this one.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.320
Okay.

00:38:42.904 --> 00:38:45.865
Oh, no, I'll pay.

00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:47.617
Hey, that wasn't our deal.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.494
Please.

00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:53.581
- You've eaten, right?
- Yes.

00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:56.501
My manager makes sure I never miss a meal.

00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:58.211
Good luck with your checkup.

00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:02.090
- Are you feeling okay?
- Of course.

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:05.218
These days, I even forget
I'm sick sometimes.

00:39:09.055 --> 00:39:10.056
Mr. Lee.

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:14.853
After you drop me off and see Dr. Minseok,

00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:16.437
are you heading somewhere?

00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:18.815
Yes, to see my mother.

00:39:18.898 --> 00:39:20.692
Today's her memorial day.

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.402
Ah.

00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:29.492
Hello.

00:39:29.576 --> 00:39:33.162
I'm here to see Dr. Lee Junghyo
at the Center for Genetic Medicine.

00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:34.247
A moment, please.

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:00.398
Go on ahead. I'll bring you your stuff.

00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:02.775
Uh…

00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:04.402
Instead of bringing my stuff,

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:05.987
could you just wait for me?

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.448
- Sorry?
- The food here is pretty amazing.

00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:10.408
You can go eat and wait for me.

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:13.369
- Why?
- "Why, why, why"! You always ask that.

00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:14.746
Because I want to go with you.

00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:17.832
Didn't I tell you
I have somewhere to be later?

00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:19.292
Okay, go.

00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:20.919
I'll wait for you then.

00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.253
Let's stick together today.

00:40:22.879 --> 00:40:25.006
- That's unnecessary.
- "Unnecessary"?

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.050
I hate that word, "unnecessary."

00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:29.093
Maybe it is, but we can still go together.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.974
All right, then. I'll wait for you.

00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:37.226
Really? Sweet! That's awesome!

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.811
It won't take long.

00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:42.523
I'll be right back.

00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:58.331
Oh, hello.

00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:00.833
Is Dr. Lee Junghyo in today?

00:41:00.917 --> 00:41:02.710
No, he's off today.

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.922
Goodness. Well, that's a bust.

00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:07.966
What is this about?

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:11.177
I have some personal business with him.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.887
By any chance, do you know

00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:14.430
this person in the middle?

00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:19.227
BE AS HAPPY AS YOU CHOOSE TO BE

00:41:27.986 --> 00:41:31.114
Daeum made that for me.
It was her birthday gift for herself.

00:41:33.366 --> 00:41:36.869
If it was her birthday,
why did she give you a gift?

00:41:36.953 --> 00:41:38.329
I know, right?

00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:39.414
Wait, hang on.

00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.499
Oh, her birthday's actually today.

00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:43.543
Pardon?

00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:46.170
Today is Daeum's birthday?

00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:48.381
Yes. Wish her a happy birthday for me.

00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:51.384
Okay.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.511
And…

00:41:54.637 --> 00:41:58.224
I'll start coming to the set once a week.

00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.475
Every day from now on…

00:42:00.977 --> 00:42:02.186
is troubling, honestly.

00:42:03.312 --> 00:42:05.732
Let me know in advance,
and I'll accommodate.

00:42:11.446 --> 00:42:12.447
But, Doctor…

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.532
is there really no way

00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:17.535
she can survive?

00:42:22.582 --> 00:42:23.875
There's somewhere we should go.

00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:44.145
Hey, is she in?

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:45.521
Yes, she just went in.

00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:46.856
Ah.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.442
- I can stay.
- Okay.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.951
I've waited forever to see her,

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:02.914
and the first thing I see
is my daughter lying down.

00:43:06.334 --> 00:43:08.419
Thank you for bringing her here yourself.

00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:10.338
Of course.

00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:13.091
How is the shoot?

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.426
Is Daeum adjusting well?

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.845
Yes, she's well. Always smiling.

00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:20.348
She says she forgets she's even sick.

00:43:22.892 --> 00:43:24.811
Man, that girl and her bluff.

00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:27.688
She's in a lot of pain

00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:29.732
but putting on a brave face.

00:43:31.484 --> 00:43:34.487
She always smiles the brightest
when she's hurting the most.

00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:36.906
So when she smiles,

00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:39.784
that's when you should worry.

00:43:43.788 --> 00:43:46.290
<i>This making movies thing…</i>

00:43:46.374 --> 00:43:49.752
<i>I love it so much!</i>

00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:52.338
How about you, Mr. Lee?

00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.883
Are you adjusting well to this situation?

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.764
I'm not too sure.

00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:05.184
You may come to regret your decision

00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:07.979
as time goes on, actually.

00:44:09.105 --> 00:44:11.941
Still, seeing as Daeum's smiling a lot,

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:15.528
I hope you smile a lot too.

00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:19.198
Yes, that's what

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:21.409
I've decided to do.

00:44:43.598 --> 00:44:44.849
All right.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.435
What's all this?

00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:49.478
What do you mean?

00:44:49.562 --> 00:44:50.646
Blow them out already.

00:44:52.273 --> 00:44:53.482
What is it? Oh.

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:55.943
Happy birthday, dear.

00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:16.756
Let's see. Do I take this off?

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:20.343
All right. There we go.

00:45:22.178 --> 00:45:23.262
That's it.

00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:24.764
I used to lick this off.

00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:28.893
- I'll cut the cake, then.
- Okay.

00:45:28.976 --> 00:45:30.061
There.

00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.896
Like this.

00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:33.689
Give it here, I'll do it.

00:45:34.357 --> 00:45:35.358
Like this.

00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:39.320
- Wow, it looks delicious.
- Okay.

00:45:41.948 --> 00:45:43.199
Dig in.

00:45:43.783 --> 00:45:46.285
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.288
Let's try it.

00:45:49.956 --> 00:45:51.832
Mmm.

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:05.805
Why are you crying?
It's supposed to be a happy day.

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:09.892
I always cry when I eat something tasty.

00:46:13.062 --> 00:46:15.231
You're just like your mom
when you do that.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.193
It's so good.

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.070
Yeah, it is.

00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:28.369
Why have you lost so much weight?

00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:31.664
I haven't.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.250
You don't even go home.

00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:35.459
Are you living here?

00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:37.003
Of course not.

00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:39.255
I'm not doing that. I'm fine.
Go on and eat.

00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:43.259
Man, this is too creamy.

00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:45.177
I prefer chocolate cake.

00:46:47.096 --> 00:46:48.514
You like chocolate?

00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:51.225
Okay, I'll get you
a chocolate cake next time.

00:46:53.185 --> 00:46:55.021
I prayed to Mom earlier.

00:46:57.064 --> 00:46:59.358
I asked her to stop you from hurting.

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:05.114
How's the shoot going? Are you having fun?

00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:07.033
It's unbelievable.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.869
Wow. It's like…

00:47:11.537 --> 00:47:13.706
stepping into a whole new world.

00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.792
Is the director treating you well?

00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:18.085
Mm-mmm.

00:47:18.169 --> 00:47:19.712
No, I treat him well.

00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:21.130
I'm very kind to him.

00:47:21.714 --> 00:47:25.092
When he tells me not to,
I double down and treat him even better.

00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:29.388
It's been a while.

00:47:29.472 --> 00:47:30.890
What?

00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:32.808
Since I've seen you smile.

00:47:37.772 --> 00:47:39.148
It's beautiful.

00:47:39.231 --> 00:47:41.192
It's beautiful when you smile.

00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:44.362
Say "ah."

00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:47.156
Ah.

00:47:50.493 --> 00:47:54.080
Now, this is what we're
supposed to eat in Gangwon-do, right?

00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:56.665
Why did you ask me to eat with you?

00:47:56.749 --> 00:47:58.167
There's a lot I don't know.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.920
Rookie actress, rookie manager, I guess?

00:48:01.003 --> 00:48:04.423
Anyway, I've been feeling bad for Daeum.

00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:07.176
I know you're busy,
but if it's not too much trouble,

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.221
do you mind
if I ask for your advice now and then?

00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:11.347
Mmm.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.474
So you were nosy for a reason.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.894
Buy me this meal and I'll consider it.

00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:19.063
Of course! Please dig in. Have everything.

00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:21.107
This is all cooked.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.691
Thank you.

00:48:26.779 --> 00:48:28.322
You eat too.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.249
Mr. Lee. Hi.

00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:41.794
It took longer than I thought.
Did I keep you too long?

00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:44.338
It's fine. Did the checkup go okay?

00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:45.423
Yes.

00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:50.761
- Did you have something to eat?
- Yes, sure.

00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:57.351
Director Lee?

00:48:58.144 --> 00:48:59.687
Goodness. Wow.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.106
What a surprise to see you here.

00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:03.524
And with Ms. Lee Daeum, no less?

00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.529
What are you doing here?

00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:12.741
And what are you doing
at a hospital with Ms. Lee?

00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:14.535
Why do you want to know that?

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.121
I'm sorry if I crossed a line.

00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:19.123
I'm the one
who wrote the article about her,

00:49:19.206 --> 00:49:20.624
so I was excited to see her.

00:49:21.917 --> 00:49:23.043
All right, then.

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:24.670
Let's go, Daeum.

00:49:27.089 --> 00:49:28.132
All right.

00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:47.151
GO HYEYOUNG
BEYOND ENTERTAINMENT

00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:48.736
No, hang on.

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:51.030
This could be an even juicier scoop.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.251
- Hello!
- Hey, Daeum! Long time no see.

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:05.753
- Have you been well?
- Yeah.

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.838
The flowers I asked for earlier…

00:50:07.922 --> 00:50:10.758
Yeah. Allium, chrysanthemum,
and baby's breath.

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.092
I have them all ready.

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:14.970
Who's that?

00:50:16.805 --> 00:50:17.848
Um…

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:22.937
A guy I'm getting to know
at a slightly fast pace.

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.564
Hello.

00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:27.274
Yes, hello.

00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:29.860
Uh… What are we doing here, Daeum?

00:50:35.658 --> 00:50:37.076
Who are we making this for?

00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:40.788
Your mother.

00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:48.003
She'd love this.

00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:52.508
That's why you need to make them pre…

00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:55.010
You're doing well.

00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:57.721
Let's take this one.

00:50:57.805 --> 00:51:01.058
She'll love it even more
since her son made it.

00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:02.851
That flower.

00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:06.397
The purple one. What's that?
It looks unusual.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.065
It's allium.

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.483
"Endless sorrow."

00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:13.529
It's a symbol for endless sorrow.

00:51:14.613 --> 00:51:17.700
It's endlessly sad to not have
someone you love by your side.

00:51:18.993 --> 00:51:21.996
No one really knows
where that sorrow ends.

00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:25.958
But if I have to live with it forever,

00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:30.129
I guess I'll have to love
this sorrow that's deep in my heart.

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:39.847
Thank you.

00:51:42.474 --> 00:51:44.476
Doesn't look like anything's wrong.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.686
Yes, it looks okay.

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.646
The catering we got was so good.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.315
- I know, right?
- Definitely.

00:51:49.398 --> 00:51:51.191
Who chose that one? It was a great choice.

00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:52.818
- It was me, of course.
- Really?

00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:55.863
Look at him being all smug.

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.489
NOH HUITAE:
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

00:51:57.573 --> 00:51:59.617
The budget's pretty much set.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.826
I think we're good to go.

00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:02.995
No problems on my end, either.

00:52:03.078 --> 00:52:06.707
THE LATE YU EUNAE

00:52:17.843 --> 00:52:18.969
Mr. Lee.

00:52:27.936 --> 00:52:29.438
I'll wait here.

00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:33.901
Let's go in together.

00:52:37.029 --> 00:52:38.030
Okay.

00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:57.508
I was wondering
who was cleaning it up all the time.

00:52:57.591 --> 00:52:58.759
It was you.

00:53:00.678 --> 00:53:02.846
How lovely.

00:53:03.806 --> 00:53:05.557
Eunae would love it.

00:53:15.317 --> 00:53:16.318
I'll head out.

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:21.365
Ms. Kim.

00:53:23.409 --> 00:53:24.618
Thank you.

00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:40.092
Goodbye.

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:48.267
THE LATE YU EUNAE

00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:09.621
Thank you for today.

00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:11.707
I should be thanking you.

00:54:12.332 --> 00:54:13.667
It must've been a hassle.

00:54:14.877 --> 00:54:16.128
It wasn't a hassle.

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.384
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:29.475
Um, Mr. Lee.

00:54:29.558 --> 00:54:30.684
Yes?

00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:33.645
Can I ask you something?

00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.731
Yes, what is it?

00:54:36.315 --> 00:54:37.983
You said before

00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:41.737
that there was no such thing as love

00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:43.989
in <i>Love in White</i>.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.991
Right.

00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:49.328
Do you still think that?

00:54:50.913 --> 00:54:52.956
I recently came across

00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:57.002
the original draft of <i>Love in White</i>.
And there…

00:54:58.003 --> 00:55:01.465
I saw my mother's name written on it.

00:55:01.548 --> 00:55:02.799
"Yu Eunae."

00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:04.760
<i>Love in White</i>…

00:55:05.886 --> 00:55:08.096
was written by my mother, not my father.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.849
Ever since I discovered that,

00:55:12.226 --> 00:55:13.685
everything's been a blur.

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:17.523
Is there really no love in <i>Love in White</i>?

00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:21.860
Or did I think there wasn't
because I resented my father so much?

00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:25.656
So I really want to find out

00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:29.993
what my mother was really trying to say
through <i>Love in White</i>.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:33.747
Can I help you find that too?

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.207
No.

00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:37.042
Oh.

00:55:37.626 --> 00:55:39.127
Because you already are.

00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:06.738
Daeum.

00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:10.117
Happy birthday.

00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:17.374
I got it from the flower shop earlier.

00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:27.384
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

00:56:35.142 --> 00:56:36.143
Auntie!

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:37.811
Gyo!

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:44.359

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:05.505
No, no! Make a wish first.

00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:07.215
Oh.

00:57:09.051 --> 00:57:10.677
I don't have to make a wish.

00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:12.596
How come?

00:57:13.722 --> 00:57:15.766
This is enough for me.

00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:17.017
And…

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.394
my wish already came true.

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:24.691
Oh, did you lay that out for me
because it's my birthday?

00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:27.861
Oh, look at you,
getting flowers from a man!

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:28.987
You're all grown up.

00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:32.324
How did you know?

00:57:35.994 --> 00:57:37.412
He loves movies, doesn't he?

00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:39.915
And makes good ones too?

00:57:44.044 --> 00:57:45.337
But it's one-sided.

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.756
It's only me who feels this way.

00:57:50.008 --> 00:57:51.677
And you said it wasn't about you.

00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:56.014
But you've kissed
and even got flowers,

00:57:56.098 --> 00:57:57.891
and it's still one-sided?

00:57:59.267 --> 00:58:00.560
That's a new spin.

00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:02.604
Is it?

00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:03.772
Does it sound weird?

00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:06.983
It's not that it's weird.

00:58:07.943 --> 00:58:10.237
Maybe you just want to believe that?

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.321
What?

00:58:11.405 --> 00:58:13.699
Are you sure it's just you?

00:58:17.285 --> 00:58:18.537
I don't think it is.

00:58:49.943 --> 00:58:52.279
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:02.330
SOMETHING IS STIRRING IN ME

00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:03.540
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN CALL THAT LOVE

00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:06.877
"Something is…

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.505
stirring in me…

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.927
but I don't know if I can call that love."

00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:23.435
OR IF I'M EVEN
SOMEONE WORTHY OF IT

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:26.646
"Or if I'm even someone…

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:29.316
worthy of it."

00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:55.634
Mr. Lee,
look at those waves crashing.

00:59:55.717 --> 00:59:56.760
It's gorgeous.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.445
You should go on in.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.241
You're not coming?

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.909
I've actually got plans.

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:22.410
Plans?

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.831
There's something
I need to finish up today.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.793
Okay, then. Take care of yourself.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:31.920
Don't worry.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.607
- Did you wait long?
- No.

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:53.775
Let's go.

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:15.630
You're not going to
confess your feelings, are you?

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.094
Way to ruin the mood.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.222
Sorry.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.892
I'm just feeling a little impatient.

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:28.602
I'm the type to go full speed,

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:30.562
but you? Jeez…

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.314
You're always hitting reverse.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.232
Then and now.

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.153
It's hard to act tough,

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.196
especially in front of someone I like.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.200
I'm like that too.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.370
I get all clumsy and awkward

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.623
in front of someone I like.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:51.833
I know

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.085
that you like someone.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:59.215
My eyes are always on you…

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:04.012
but yours are always on someone else.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.681
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.143
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes, it's good.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.521
Is that what you wanted to ask me?

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.492
<i>And that person's eyes…</i>

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:28.703
<i>are always on you too.</i>

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.540
You didn't know? It's so obvious.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.003
Actually,

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.131
I did know.

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:42.050
I felt it too.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.261
- But…
- No, stop.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.930
My story comes first.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.684
I'm just a stand-in, so I'll leave soon.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:53.770
And honestly, there's no room for me here.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.815
This isn't me trying to look cool.
I really mean it.

01:02:58.066 --> 01:02:59.234
When I see you,

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.444
you seem good.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:03.613
You look happy.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:06.950
That's all I need.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.119
You've got a good eye, Eunho.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:13.748
I really am happy.

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:22.924
In about 30 minutes,
the sun will begin to set.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.428
You see that lighthouse?

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.555
I heard the view's amazing there.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.725
I'm off to drink some soju.

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.175
LEE DAEUM

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.057
Yes?

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.183
Mr. Lee.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.269
I don't have an excuse or anything.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:18.646
You know the yellow lighthouse?

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.356
Can you meet me there?

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.817
I want to see the sunset with you.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.945
<i>But you have to run</i>
<i>since the sun's setting soon.</i>

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.297
I'm not late, am I?

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:43.189
I want to run until my heart bursts too.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.237
So that's what it felt like.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:51.990
I'd forgotten that.

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:56.244
I keep forgetting things
when I'm with you.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:05:59.455
You're sick,

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.208
but I don't see that.

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:07.672
There's no time,
but it feels like there is.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:14.679
I like you,

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:18.516
but I feel like I shouldn't.

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:24.939
I thought I was mistaken…

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.154
but I know all too well that it's real.

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:17.468
<i>That feeling of wondering</i>
<i>if it's okay to love someone who's dying?</i>

01:08:17.552 --> 01:08:18.803
<i>I don't know it either.</i>

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:23.391
Are you seeing Daeum?

01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:25.268
Can you… do that?

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:27.729
