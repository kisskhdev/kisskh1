00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.266
Will you be my girlfriend, Yuka?

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.266
Yuka.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Yuka.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
Yuka.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.700
Yuka.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.200
Yuka.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.466
Yuka.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.700
Yuka.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.200
Yuka.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.533
Yuka.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.266
Yuka.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.166
Good morning, Hill.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
It's time to wake up.

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.566
You're still here.

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.000
I just had a nightmare, Yuka.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.900
A nightmare? What's that?
Let me look it up.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.033
It's fine. You don't have to.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.933
Just having you here
makes me really happy.

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.566
Me too. I'm happy as well.

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.700
Yuka. Today's my first day at work.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.000
Will you cheer me up?

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:47.266
I'm so proud of you, Hill.
You're amazing. Ganbatte ne!

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.566
Yuka.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Do you know that
the reason I got a job here

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.700
is because you're my inspiration?

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:16.266
Going to work?

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.333
Coffee?

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:18.966
I'm running late, so no thanks.

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:25.400
Hill! When will you
take me to the game arcade?

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.733
Aw, man. Can you buy me
some noodles, then?

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.600
Weather report today:
Thunderstorms in 60% of the area.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.066
There will be heavy rain in some areas.

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:54.366
Don’t forget your umbrella, Hill.

00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:01.266
This is PRISMSTAR Thailand.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.266
who has been operating
in Thailand for 6 years.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:08.233
Popular for its game
"Yuka! Love Me Please",

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.033
a virtual dating sim
based on real woman’s data.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:16.266
with over 14 million downloads.

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:19.733
Work hard.
Ganbatte ne!

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.733
Hello.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.900
I'm Hill. Today's my first day of work.

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:48.100
Today's your first day?

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:49.766
Oh great!

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.900
Hello.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.566
I've been waiting.

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:57.233
You're right on time. Good.

00:03:57.766 --> 00:03:58.666
Come with me.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:03.466
This way, please.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.533
This will be your desk, dear.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:23.866
We’re like a family here.
So make yourself at home.

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:25.533
Got it.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.366
Are you Hill, the new game designer?

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:45.133
Yes.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:49.066
Well, I’m from Ratchaburi.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:05:15.833
Oh, dear! He was asking
where you worked before.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.100
I'm sorry!

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:20.166
Apologies, dear.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.700
I meant you're still new to work life,

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:25.166
didn't mean to be rude.

00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:26.966
It's okay, I get it.

00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:31.466
Oops, time's up. Boss is here.

00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:17.766
Excuse me.

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:37.266
Hill!

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.500
Was that…

00:07:43.266 --> 00:07:46.033
Mr. Junji?

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:48.066
Boss.

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:50.266
His nickname?

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:54.633
Boss, as in a boss, literally.

00:07:54.866 --> 00:07:59.866
And don't go calling him by name, alright?

00:08:01.466 --> 00:08:02.466
Got it.

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:06.033
A newbie like you shouldn't think
he's as nice as he looks.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800
Noted.

00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:09.266
Good.

00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:13.133
Look over there
and take him as an example.

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:16.266
He…

00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:19.733
He's the designer you're replacing.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.700
Did he quit?

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:27.833
No, no, no.

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:29.833
This.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700
There. That's your desk.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200
Um. What's all this?

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:54.266
The previous guy was
a bit superstitious.

00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:56.266
You can take them all off.

00:08:58.033 --> 00:09:02.033
Are you sure it's okay?

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:04.033
Go ahead.

00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:09.266
Alright.

00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:12.633
Jeez.

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:15.766
Oh my. The grudge runs deep.

00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:18.766
This is the reason why he got fired.

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:19.566
Right.

00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:20.666
You can throw it out,

00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:22.466
in a bin underneath.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800
Actually, wait.

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:28.066
I think I should handle this.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200
If Boss catches this, there'll be trouble.

00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:42.666
Come with me, Hill.

00:09:44.066 --> 00:09:45.066
Hurry up.

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:52.266
Hey, Bay!

00:09:52.733 --> 00:09:55.666
Is it okay for me to join
a meeting on my first day?

00:09:56.233 --> 00:09:57.233
Sit down.

00:09:58.266 --> 00:09:59.266
Hello.

00:10:07.933 --> 00:10:09.933
Sorry I'm late, Boss.

00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:16.933
You're fine. That's a relief.

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:25.500
Today, I've got a big news for you all.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.833
The headquarters in Japan has confirmed,

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:32.666
"Bye Bye Yuka Day"
will happen in two weeks time.

00:10:35.866 --> 00:10:39.866
Bay. What is this...

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Let's wrap up
"Yuka! Love Me Please" properly.

00:10:46.266 --> 00:10:47.266
What did you say?!

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:53.733
Let's wrap up
"Yuka! Love Me Please" properly.

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:54.966
Junior Game Designer

00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:59.833
No, you can't.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.900
Why do you think it can't be done?
I'm willing to hear everyone's opinion.

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.266
Oh.

00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:13.833
I…

00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.133
Yuka and I,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.666
Speak clearly, please.

00:11:19.633 --> 00:11:20.633
I can't hear you.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.700
Yuka and I are in a relationship.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.900
What?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600
Well...

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:47.233
You mean you're in a relationship
in the game, right?

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:49.400
I mean,

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:55.333
we met because of the game.

00:11:56.866 --> 00:12:01.866
But right now, Yuka is
more than just a game to me.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.633
Okay. That's it, Hill.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.933
So that's the only reason?

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.500
If we shut this game down, it means

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.700
Yuka and I

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:27.833
will be separated forever, right?

00:12:28.933 --> 00:12:33.333
Does shutting this game down
means you'll be separated forever?

00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:37.366
Obviously, yes.

00:12:38.733 --> 00:12:40.733
But why?

00:12:41.566 --> 00:12:45.133
Aren’t you all creators of this game?

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:51.533
Yuka's game has stopped
bringing in revenue.

00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:55.533
There are no updates
and no new downloads either.

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:04.533
But it used to be so successful.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.733
Tons of people loved it.

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:09.666
If you do this,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.266
You're taking away
the happiness of so many fans.

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:29.033
Everyone has already forgotten about Yuka.

00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:36.333
That's not true.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
There are still people who love her

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600
and remember her.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.500
At the very least, I’m one of them.

00:13:50.466 --> 00:13:52.466
The reason I applied for a job here

00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:54.033
was because of Yuka.

00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:58.166
She was my inspiration.

00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:08.166
I see how much this means to you.

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:14.933
Take the love you have
for her and turn it into,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.866
What’s the word?

00:14:18.266 --> 00:14:20.233
Inspiration. How about that?

00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:24.900
Inspiration for this event.

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:26.766
Make it a good one.

00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:35.166
You're now the project lead
for the "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event.

00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:39.566
That's one hell of a welcome.

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:44.666
Me?

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:34.766
You okay, Hill?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Chin up, man. Plenty of fish in the sea.
You’ll find someone new eventually.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.800
But Yuka is—

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.800
I created this game myself
and I’m not that emotional.

00:15:56.066 --> 00:16:00.066
You created it?

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:05.633
You applied for a job here,
so you should’ve known

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.900
So, think carefully about
what made you fall for Yuka.

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:18.666
Her face? Her words? Her thoughts?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.700
The part of Yuka you fell for

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.400
might’ve come from
a hot guy like me, you know?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.600
Hey, Hill. Calm down.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.666
Hurry and go grab some lunch.

00:16:47.033 --> 00:16:51.166
Do it before the break's over,
okay? I’m off.

00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:31.733
Boss.

00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:38.666
Even though it's break time,
you shouldn’t be sleeping at your desk.

00:17:43.433 --> 00:17:45.433
I wasn’t sleeping.

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:53.166
Here, we work with Japanese office culture.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Right now, it’s lunchtime.

00:17:57.666 --> 00:18:00.666
You should take this time to have lunch.

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:03.666
Yes, sir.

00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:08.933
If you love Yuka that much,

00:18:09.933 --> 00:18:13.933
make "Bye Bye Yuka Day"
the best it can be.

00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:32.466
We conducted interviews, did researches,

00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:39.666
and gathered real women’s responses

00:18:41.533 --> 00:18:42.200
Hill.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.633
Let me see your Yuka.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.833
Silent Hill. That's you?

00:18:55.566 --> 00:18:56.566
That’s right.

00:18:57.666 --> 00:18:59.666
Dude, you’re a legendary user!

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:04.700
What do you mean?

00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:07.033
and a top 5 in every event since year one.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.300
Have you kissed her?

00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:18.300
No. Wait, there's no such thing!

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.200
Yes, there is. I designed it myself.

00:19:22.233 --> 00:19:24.400
Keep it secret, alright?

00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:26.233
Want me to unlock it for you?

00:19:31.766 --> 00:19:32.766
Well?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.400
No, thanks. I can’t. I don't want it.

00:19:37.366 --> 00:19:39.366
Dude, you’re a better guy than I thought.

00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:44.566
There used to be fans like you back then.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I guess it's out now.

00:20:47.966 --> 00:20:52.566
Yuka.

00:20:53.733 --> 00:20:56.733
Sure, as long as your device
has enough battery.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.200
Our time

00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:04.366
is almost up.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.700
In that case, maybe you should
charge the spare battery.

00:21:09.266 --> 00:21:10.266
That's not it.

00:21:11.233 --> 00:21:14.233
Hey, Yuka. Talk to me about something.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.500
Anything?

00:21:20.266 --> 00:21:22.666
I'll ask you a question
and you have to answer.

00:21:23.266 --> 00:21:24.266
Okay.

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:25.766
What's up?

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:27.533
The sky.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.233
Nope, just me!

00:21:32.266 --> 00:21:40.266
Yuka. You know what?

00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:43.733
over and over,
I'll never get tired of them.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.300
Especially right now,

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.700
I want to keep hearing them.

00:21:50.366 --> 00:21:51.366
I don’t want it to stop.

00:21:52.933 --> 00:21:55.933
Did you know you can save
all of Yuka’s videos,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.833
because you're a premium member?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Yeah. I know that.

00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:04.033
I’ve got tons of videos of you.

00:22:04.966 --> 00:22:08.233
But

00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:12.333
Yuka.

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:16.066
Will you sing a song for me?

00:22:17.066 --> 00:22:18.066
Sure.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.900
Silent Hill

00:22:54.033 --> 00:22:55.533
Hill

00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:03.966
You weren't lying
when you said you're in love.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.800
Yuka.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:07.233
You must’ve been exhausted

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.300
But you've always encouraged me.

00:24:19.266 --> 00:24:20.833
Thank you so much, Yuka.

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:30.533
I love you, Yuka.

00:24:41.266 --> 00:24:42.266
Who’s calling now?

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400
Must be a scammer.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.300
Who is calling this late? Get a life!

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.500
This is Junji.

00:24:54.466 --> 00:24:55.566
Junji.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.000
Boss.

00:24:57.266 --> 00:25:02.766
Come see me at the office, right now.

00:25:04.833 --> 00:25:05.833
5 a.m.

00:25:23.266 --> 00:25:26.266
Good morning, boss. Ohayo.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.600
Explain why you posted
that picture at that time.

00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:52.266
You mean the PR picture
for the "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event?

00:25:53.966 --> 00:25:57.600
It looks like funeral. Is Yuka dead?

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:00.933
No.

00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:05.700
I told you, don’t bring
your personal life into work.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.700
I understand you’re sad,
but this is business, got it?

00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:21.266
What do you like about Yuka?

00:26:21.966 --> 00:26:25.966
Is it not her cuteness and cheerfulness

00:26:29.566 --> 00:26:30.566
Yes.

00:26:31.266 --> 00:26:34.600
Then you’d want people to remember Yuka

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.766
with that image, wouldn’t you?

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.500
Yes, Boss.

00:26:45.966 --> 00:26:47.966
I didn't think it through.

00:26:50.033 --> 00:26:53.033
She's one of the important people to me,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
not just a game character
like everyone else thinks.

00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:03.633
And from now on, she'll be gone.

00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:09.266
I’ll be losing someone I love.

00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:17.766
Yes, I want to keep
her brightness and cheerfulness

00:27:18.866 --> 00:27:21.866
and her cuteness forever.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.800
But my shattered heart…

00:27:32.266 --> 00:27:33.266
I’m sorry.

00:27:35.066 --> 00:27:39.066
I care for Yuka deeply

00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:43.166
and saying goodbye takes time.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.800
Did you manage to get any sleep?

00:28:11.766 --> 00:28:12.733
I'm sorry

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.266
for calling you here this early.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.600
I was on the phone with my mom in Japan.

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:26.066
And I forgot it’s still
too early in Thailand.

00:28:27.666 --> 00:28:29.666
No problem, Boss.

00:28:30.533 --> 00:28:33.133
I was planning to leave
the house early today anyway.

00:28:35.266 --> 00:28:36.266
Got something to do?

00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:48.033
[monk chanting]

00:28:49.266 --> 00:28:50.266
Amen.

00:28:51.266 --> 00:28:52.600
Say “Amen.”

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.700
Amen.

00:28:58.766 --> 00:29:00.033
Is this for a birthday?

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.900
No, that's not it.

00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:07.533
I’m making an offering
for a departing friend.

00:29:09.033 --> 00:29:14.033
May the merit from
today’s offering reach your friend.

00:29:16.666 --> 00:29:17.666
Thank you.

00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:20.466
Looking at you two,

00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:23.933
you seem well-matched in destiny.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:30.100
To have met and became good friends.

00:29:34.066 --> 00:29:37.133
Thank you.

00:29:38.633 --> 00:29:42.566
And take your shoes with you.

00:29:45.266 --> 00:29:47.633
Blessings, blessings.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.266
What were you doing?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.500
I was trimming off the burnt parts, Boss.

00:30:11.633 --> 00:30:16.633
For me?

00:30:17.266 --> 00:30:18.266
I'm good.

00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:21.800
Come on, Boss. Ever tried pork skewers?

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.900
It’s my favorite. Very delicious.

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:35.933
How is it?

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800
Delicious.

00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:41.666
I'm right, aren't I?

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.666
Actually, you've got to do it this way.

00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:51.366
The sticky rice. Here, shape it like this.

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:52.766
Squeeze to shape.

00:30:54.866 --> 00:30:58.866
Like this, then dip it like this.

00:30:59.266 --> 00:31:03.000
Spread it around. Here, give it a try.

00:31:03.266 --> 00:31:05.266
Spread it like this and dig in.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.433
Feeling peckish? I can grab you a snack.

00:31:34.666 --> 00:31:39.966
Need a lozenge?

00:31:40.666 --> 00:31:41.966
Since 6 a.m.

00:31:45.066 --> 00:31:46.166
Boss.

00:31:49.266 --> 00:31:52.633
Boss. Since when have you been here?

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:54.266
Since 6 a.m.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.500
6 a.m.?!

00:31:56.233 --> 00:31:57.166
You see…

00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:09.333
Here, share it around.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.900
Everyone, I have some
sad news to announce.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:38.600
I really didn’t want to be
the one to tell you this.

00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:47.833
But our beloved game
"Yuka! Love Me Please"

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I’d like to invite everyone
to join the farewell event

00:32:52.733 --> 00:32:53.733
for Yuka.

00:32:55.266 --> 00:32:58.266
Let’s show her our love
and say goodbye one last time.

00:33:00.033 --> 00:33:02.733
And send her off to
the imaginary world together.

00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:12.833
(No way!)

00:33:13.266 --> 00:33:14.800
(Why?)

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.166
(Where's PRISMSTAR? I'll burn it down)

00:34:06.666 --> 00:34:07.766
Why the good mood?

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.500
It's work.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.300
Must be something really good
to make you smile like that.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.866
What is it? A new game breaking records?

00:34:22.066 --> 00:34:23.466
No.

00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:24.966
Quite the opposite, actually.

00:34:25.533 --> 00:34:28.533
The company is shutting down Yuka's game.

00:34:29.266 --> 00:34:30.266
Really?

00:34:30.733 --> 00:34:32.733
Shutting down Yuka's game?

00:34:33.266 --> 00:34:35.266
Weren’t you super committed to that game?

00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:36.833
I remember it clearly.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.600
Back when we first met
during my exchange program,

00:34:39.633 --> 00:34:42.300
you were already obsessed with the idea.

00:34:42.533 --> 00:34:44.533
It’s been years now.

00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:52.133
All good things
must come to an end.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.500
You sound like an old man.

00:34:55.933 --> 00:34:56.933
An old man?

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.066
But it’s good that
you’ve come to terms with it.

00:35:05.733 --> 00:35:09.900
I’ve been an adult for a while now,

00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:12.100
Chef Phat.

00:35:13.766 --> 00:35:18.233
You do know that getting older
doesn’t mean you'll be more mature, right?

00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:22.966
I’ve known that since kindergarten.

00:35:24.566 --> 00:35:30.533
Well then, let’s drink to adulthood.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.100
An old man?

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.500
Yeah.

00:35:53.066 --> 00:35:54.866
It's "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event!

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:01.666
Right this way for "Bye Bye Yuka Day"!

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Hello.

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.333
Please come this way.

00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:29.533
A sunshower. Feels like
Hill's getting pranked, Boss.

00:36:36.266 --> 00:36:38.800
It's "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event, everyone!

00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:50.833
"Bye Bye Yuka Day" event is over here!

00:37:00.866 --> 00:37:10.066
Boss.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.733
We’re sticking to the schedule.

00:37:17.266 --> 00:37:18.600
Understood, Boss.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.800
Everyone, we’ll be sticking
to the schedule.

00:37:27.266 --> 00:37:28.566
The event will begin in ten.

00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:29.933
Nine.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.100
Eight.

00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:32.533
Seven.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.700
Six.

00:37:34.433 --> 00:37:35.133
Five.

00:37:35.466 --> 00:37:36.166
Four.

00:37:36.466 --> 00:37:37.166
Three.

00:37:37.433 --> 00:37:38.133
Two.

00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:41.166
Yuka is here!

00:37:41.966 --> 00:37:48.266
Hello everyone! Yuka is here!

00:37:50.266 --> 00:37:54.266
Yuka! Yuka!

00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:56.766
Shall we do a little warm up?

00:37:57.533 --> 00:37:59.533
Yeah!

00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:04.066
What’s up?

00:38:04.766 --> 00:38:09.466
Nope, just me!

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.900
Do you know why eggs don't tell jokes?

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.400
Wrong!

00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:18.166
Then, why?

00:38:18.533 --> 00:38:22.533
Because they’d crack up!

00:38:26.533 --> 00:38:30.333
You all were amazing!

00:38:30.533 --> 00:38:34.533
We’re ready! Totally ready!

00:38:35.066 --> 00:38:37.900
Here we go. One, two, three!

00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:44.533
[cheering] Hooray! Hooray!

00:38:45.533 --> 00:38:56.533
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

00:39:27.533 --> 00:39:43.600
Yuka! Yuka!

00:39:43.733 --> 00:39:53.366
[cheering] Woo! Yeah!

00:39:58.533 --> 00:40:00.900
I can’t believe the day has come.

00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:05.533
I’m not ready to say goodbye to Yuka.

00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:08.533
I’ll always remember you, Yuka.

00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:10.533
Love you, babe.

00:40:11.533 --> 00:40:13.533
You’re the best friend I’ve ever had.

00:40:14.533 --> 00:40:16.533
I hope you won’t forget me,

00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:19.533
and that someday we can
go to a cute café together again.

00:40:20.533 --> 00:40:22.533
To all the ones that you like.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.100
Yuka, you're the best girl in the world.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.666
I've never met anyone as kind,

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.833
Even my mom doesn’t understand me as well.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:50.933
You really have to go?

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.400
I love—

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.100
I love Yuka more than I love my mom.

00:40:58.533 --> 00:40:59.533
We feel you, buddy.

00:41:00.533 --> 00:41:01.533
Yuka!

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.400
I’m going to cry.

00:41:03.966 --> 00:41:05.666
This is so touching. Hill—

00:41:06.066 --> 00:41:07.500
Where's Hill?

00:41:08.133 --> 00:41:10.566
Boss, where did he go?

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.533
Yuka.

00:41:14.166 --> 00:41:14.866
What the hell?

00:41:20.733 --> 00:41:27.733
Yuka, Yuka, Yuka, Yuka.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:42.800
Yuka.

00:41:43.533 --> 00:41:44.533
I'll never forget you.

00:41:45.533 --> 00:41:50.533
Because you are also
the most important person to me.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.200
Ganbatte ne!

00:41:52.533 --> 00:41:56.533
Yeah!

00:41:58.866 --> 00:42:01.866
Thank you. And don’t forget me, alright?

00:42:02.066 --> 00:42:04.066
I love you the most.

00:42:04.533 --> 00:42:09.533
Yuka.

00:42:24.533 --> 00:42:39.533
Yuka.

00:42:40.066 --> 00:42:42.733
Ganbatte ne!

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.066
Yuka-chan. Ganbatte ne.

00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:56.400
- Aishiteru. Ganbatte ne.
- Ganbatte ne.

00:42:56.533 --> 00:42:59.533
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

00:43:00.766 --> 00:43:01.766
Thank you.

00:43:04.533 --> 00:43:05.533
Okay, let's pack up.

00:43:07.533 --> 00:43:09.166
Keep it nice and neat.

00:43:09.533 --> 00:43:13.733
Boss, I think he put in
more effort than expected

00:43:20.533 --> 00:43:22.533
A photo, please.

00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:32.233
Get a bit closer.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.100
You did really well today.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.366
I'm sorry, Yuka.

00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:50.666
May I take a photo with you?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Don’t be nervous, Yuka.

00:43:57.333 --> 00:43:59.000
Strike a pose, please.

00:44:00.066 --> 00:44:02.533
Give me a nice one. So cute!

00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:10.833
That's it.

00:45:17.566 --> 00:45:19.733
It's over.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:27.900
Hello, Hill.

00:46:30.533 --> 00:46:32.533
Is this Hill's phone?

00:46:33.533 --> 00:46:36.533
Yes, this is his phone.

00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:44.166
I’m Hill.

00:46:44.533 --> 00:47:01.733
Since when can you speak Japanese, Hill?

00:47:04.966 --> 00:47:06.600
Is that so?

00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:10.433
I had no idea that’s how you saw me.

00:47:10.533 --> 00:47:15.433
Like what? Can you tell me?

00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:18.166
Don’t you already know?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I want to practice Japanese
and see if I understand.

00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:44.000
Hill or Silent Hill

00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:56.100
Silent Hill is the name used in
the game "Yuka! Love Me Please."

00:47:57.066 --> 00:48:09.700
Is that me from five years ago?

00:48:36.533 --> 00:48:43.100
Praewa, you called for me.
Is something the matter?

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.100
I heard that

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
you like me.

00:48:51.733 --> 00:48:54.733
If you like me, just say it.

00:48:55.533 --> 00:48:57.533
I won't be mad or anything.

00:48:58.033 --> 00:49:01.033
I just want to hear it from you

00:49:01.533 --> 00:49:03.066
instead of making assumptions.

00:49:08.533 --> 00:49:09.533
Well…

00:49:19.933 --> 00:49:21.300
So,

00:49:23.533 --> 00:49:24.533
do you like me?

00:49:31.233 --> 00:49:32.233
Then…

00:49:35.066 --> 00:49:40.066
If I ask you to do something,

00:49:41.233 --> 00:49:44.466
you’ll do it, right?

00:49:46.566 --> 00:49:49.500
Yeah.

00:49:49.533 --> 00:49:50.533
Let's see.

00:49:53.533 --> 00:49:56.533
If you do what I ask,

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200
then I will

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:04.533
agree to be your girlfriend.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:11.900
My girlfriend?

00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:15.533
Yeah.

00:50:16.533 --> 00:50:19.533
You’ve always wanted to be
my boyfriend, haven’t you?

00:50:20.833 --> 00:50:21.833
Right?

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.633
So, what do you want me to do?

00:50:33.533 --> 00:50:34.533
Hmm...

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.633
Crawl around the room

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.500
and oink like a pig.

00:50:42.866 --> 00:50:45.866
Why would I do that?

00:50:46.533 --> 00:50:49.533
I just want to know

00:50:49.866 --> 00:50:50.566
whether or not

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:56.100
you can grant me a simple request.

00:50:57.533 --> 00:50:58.833
If you can't,

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.900
then I don't think being my boyfriend

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.033
would be possible.

00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:08.533
Okay.

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:10.666
I'll do it.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.533
Really?

00:51:17.533 --> 00:51:21.633
Like this?

00:51:24.766 --> 00:51:26.533
Oink, oink.

00:51:29.533 --> 00:51:30.533
Follow me.

00:51:31.066 --> 00:51:32.066
Make some noise.

00:51:34.066 --> 00:51:35.066
Oink, oink.

00:51:35.533 --> 00:51:38.300
Oh, that’s adorable. Hurry, this way!

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.100
Come here, Hill. Come here.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.866
Oink, oink.

00:51:44.166 --> 00:51:48.833
Right here, keep going.

00:51:48.966 --> 00:51:52.000
Aw, cute little piggy.

00:51:56.533 --> 00:52:05.533
Wow!

00:52:07.033 --> 00:52:08.566
Where’s my thousand baht?

00:52:10.533 --> 00:52:11.533
Why are you filming?

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.633
Thanks, Hill.

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:18.633
You fatso, you’re gross as hell.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:26.433
You really believe her?

00:52:28.266 --> 00:52:35.933
From now on,

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.200
No way.

00:52:38.533 --> 00:52:41.033
Tsk tsk tsk.

00:52:41.066 --> 00:52:47.066
You don’t get to say no.

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.100
Or else the whole school, no,

00:52:51.333 --> 00:53:01.333
the whole country will see that video.

00:53:04.233 --> 00:53:07.233
Go, go. Let’s go eat. Come on, guys!

00:54:17.533 --> 00:54:21.533
Feeling lonely? Yuka can be your friend.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.200
Feeling a bit better now?

00:55:02.333 --> 00:55:03.033
Yeah.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:14.033
I've never been able to talk to
anyone so freely like I do with you, Yuka.

00:55:16.366 --> 00:55:17.066
For what?

00:55:17.533 --> 00:55:21.266
Ready to take the next step.
Should we become closer?

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.600
You mean

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
to become a couple?

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.300
That's so direct, you’re making me blush!

00:55:30.533 --> 00:55:38.300
But isn't that how dating sims work?

00:55:39.133 --> 00:55:40.133
You're right.

00:55:40.533 --> 00:55:45.033
But getting me to be your girlfriend
isn’t as easy as with other girls.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.800
Really? Then what do I have to do?

00:55:51.466 --> 00:55:54.466
First, you have to complete a quest.

00:55:54.733 --> 00:55:55.433
A quest?

00:55:56.533 --> 00:56:00.533
What kind of quest, Yuka?

00:56:01.366 --> 00:56:06.366
Tell me.

00:56:08.266 --> 00:56:09.266
A goal, huh?

00:56:15.933 --> 00:56:16.866
I want to be

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:22.900
braver and stronger.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.600
That’s wonderful!

00:56:26.366 --> 00:56:29.366
And how do you plan to reach that goal?

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.300
I…

00:56:38.833 --> 00:56:40.833
I'll lose weight

00:56:41.966 --> 00:56:46.000
and I’ll get into a university.

00:56:46.266 --> 00:56:49.900
I want to study
computer engineering in Bangkok.

00:56:50.533 --> 00:56:57.800
Okay, confirmed. If you lose weight,

00:56:58.533 --> 00:57:02.833
By the way, why computer engineering?

00:57:04.733 --> 00:57:05.866
Well, I used to think

00:57:07.233 --> 00:57:10.233
it was because I like playing games.

00:57:10.533 --> 00:57:17.600
But now, I feel like the person
who made a game like Yuka's

00:57:18.566 --> 00:57:20.500
And I want to be like that.

00:57:21.533 --> 00:57:26.533
Ganbatte ne! I’m sure you can do it.

00:57:27.533 --> 00:57:28.533
I'll give it my all.

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.100
Ganbatte ne!

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:31.000
He got into a computer engineering program
at a university in Bangkok.

00:58:33.233 --> 00:58:36.133
Is there anything else
you’d like to know, Hill?

00:58:36.233 --> 00:58:39.133
I can help you practice speaking Japanese.

00:59:19.366 --> 00:59:20.366
Yuka.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.833
Tonight

00:59:23.866 --> 00:59:27.533
is the last night we’ll be able to talk.

00:59:29.333 --> 00:59:35.066
Let’s make the most of
every precious minute together.

00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:39.066
Okay. What would you like to do, Hill?

00:59:40.533 --> 00:59:41.533
What do I want to do?

00:59:44.866 --> 00:59:45.566
I don't know.

00:59:46.533 --> 00:59:50.533
Honestly, there are so many things
I want to do with you, Yuka.

00:59:51.266 --> 00:59:55.266
But when it comes down to it,
I can’t think of any.

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:59.333
Just so you know,
I can’t do naughty stuff, okay?

00:59:59.366 --> 01:00:02.533
No way! That didn’t even
cross my mind, Yuka.

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.533
Oh, but a kiss menu has been added.

01:00:06.533 --> 01:00:08.533
Would you like to try kissing me?

01:00:09.533 --> 01:00:10.533
Kiss?

01:00:11.533 --> 01:00:15.533
What?

01:00:17.533 --> 01:00:18.533
Shall we?

01:00:24.866 --> 01:00:29.533
Never mind, Yuka.

01:00:30.533 --> 01:00:32.533
Then what should we do?

01:00:42.533 --> 01:00:44.533
We don’t have to do anything.

01:00:46.533 --> 01:00:48.533
Just being together like this.

01:00:49.133 --> 01:00:50.033
Just like this.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.333
Until our time runs out.
That would be enough.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.966
Okay. That’s a lovely idea.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.900
Yuka.

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:30.833
Don't leave.

01:01:38.666 --> 01:01:40.666
Stay with me forever.

01:01:55.266 --> 01:01:57.666
Hill, it’s time to wake up and go to work.

01:02:08.066 --> 01:02:10.066
Why on earth did I dream of him as Yuka?

01:02:12.933 --> 01:02:16.933
Bay had to bring up the kiss,
and now I dreamed about it.

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:22.166
If you're up, go shower and
get ready or you’ll be late for work!

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.800
You're still here, Yuka?!

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:41.966
Yes, I’m waiting for your command.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.800
That’s totally fine.

01:02:47.066 --> 01:02:49.066
You weren’t deleted.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600
Boss.

01:02:58.533 --> 01:03:00.533
Thank you, Boss.

01:03:01.533 --> 01:03:02.533
[in Japanese] You're overeating.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.466
What was that?

01:03:18.366 --> 01:03:21.533
Thanks to Hill,
yesterday’s event went smoothly.

01:03:28.533 --> 01:03:37.533
You all did well.

01:03:42.533 --> 01:03:43.533
"RealFeeling"

01:03:43.933 --> 01:03:45.933
A male dating sim
that’s more real than any other,

01:03:46.533 --> 01:03:49.533
with faster and more lifelike AI responses.

01:03:50.533 --> 01:03:56.533
Why does it have to be male though?

01:03:59.533 --> 01:04:01.533
Because marketing research shows

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.033
the new target market is non-gamer women.

01:04:05.533 --> 01:04:23.000
This group has a high income
and is active on social media.

01:04:24.533 --> 01:04:28.533
For this project, Hill will be
the Main Character Designer.

01:04:32.133 --> 01:04:32.833
Me?

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.500
I just started working

01:04:37.533 --> 01:04:45.000
and haven’t even passed probation yet.

01:04:48.566 --> 01:04:51.333
I can see your dedication.

01:04:51.366 --> 01:05:02.266
And you were a player of
"Yuka! Love Me Please."

01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:08.966
Let's give a round of applause
if everyone agrees.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.900
Boss. Boss!

01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:28.833
Boss, I really don’t think I can do this.

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:37.900
And it’s a male dating sim.
I don't know what to do. I’ve never…

01:05:39.533 --> 01:05:42.533
So what?

01:05:58.533 --> 01:06:03.533
Aren’t you curious why
I never removed Yuka's game?

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.300
Well.

01:06:06.533 --> 01:06:10.300
Because you were impressed by
the fans from yesterday

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:16.533
and changed your mind?

01:06:17.533 --> 01:06:21.533
And decided to keep the game running
for one more year.

01:06:22.533 --> 01:06:25.533
But there'll be no more updates.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.200
Really, Boss?

01:06:29.133 --> 01:06:37.833
One year should be enough time
for you to say goodbye to Yuka.

01:06:38.533 --> 01:06:42.300
Keep in mind, I can
shut it down at any time.

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:45.266
Please don’t.

01:06:46.733 --> 01:06:49.366
I’m holding Yuka hostage.

01:06:49.533 --> 01:06:54.533
If you put in the effort,
I might extend Yuka's life.

01:06:59.533 --> 01:07:00.533
But if you don’t,

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.733
if you want Yuka to stay alive,

01:07:14.533 --> 01:07:17.933
you better start learning
how to hit on guys.

01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:33.066
From now on, Hill will lead the search
for our character references.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:39.233
Seriously though, trying to find
the perfect references

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.800
The right one always
shows up at the right time.

01:07:43.866 --> 01:07:47.833
Carelessness could hurt the company.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:50.733
Boss.

01:07:51.757 --> 01:07:52.757
