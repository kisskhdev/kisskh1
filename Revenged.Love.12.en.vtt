00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.800
(Episode 12,
Why Doesn't He Play By the Rules?)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What are you doing?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.960
This way, you'll feel less nervous.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480
What's this?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.080
Don't tell me...

00:03:58.805 --> 00:03:59.845
Call me Hubby.

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:01.685
Call me Hubby.

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:05.605
No.

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:48.685
Good morning.

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:50.325
Let's have breakfast.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.085
Let me help you up.

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:00.405
It's okay.

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:01.725
I can get up myself.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.125
Slowly.

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:30.085
Have some breakfast.

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:41.405
Sit down.

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:12.565
I prepared breakfast for you.

00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:22.245
Make sure you nourish yourself.

00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:25.045
I'm afraid you can't take it
after only a few times.

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:34.325
Here.

00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:35.925
Try this.

00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:39.245
- Tonight...
- Today,

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:42.125
I want to go home.

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:43.165
My mom misses me.

00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:48.005
My mom really misses me.

00:06:49.045 --> 00:06:50.045
Okay.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:52.725
After you finish breakfast,

00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:54.765
I'll drive you home.

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:55.765
It's okay.

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:56.965
I can go home by myself.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.125
I'm fine.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.005
Can't I tell what you're thinking?

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:23.125
Teacher.

00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:24.845
Pick up the phone.

00:07:24.925 --> 00:07:25.964
I miss you so much.

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:28.245
I really want to talk to you.

00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:30.685
(Jiang Xiao Shuai)

00:07:34.365 --> 00:07:36.365
What exactly are you doing?

00:07:37.405 --> 00:07:39.725
(Jiang Xiao Shuai)

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:42.485
This won't do.

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:43.765
I'm going to look for him.

00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:01.285
What's wrong?

00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:02.765
I'm fine.

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:04.285
Where's Dr. Xiao Shuai?

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:06.165
He hasn't made
a house call for days.

00:08:07.045 --> 00:08:08.485
He hasn't made house calls for days?

00:08:08.885 --> 00:08:09.885
Where did he go?

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:12.125
When I went to his house
to look for him,

00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:13.605
his neighbor said the same thing,

00:08:13.805 --> 00:08:15.404
that he hasn't been home for days.

00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:16.805
He came in the middle of the night.

00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:18.325
One night, after 2am,

00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:20.421
I saw him standing alone
in front of the clinic.

00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:22.245
At first, I thought he was a thief.

00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:23.325
He was all covered up.

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:24.885
It turned out to be
Dr. Jiang himself.

00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:27.245
He came in the middle of the night?

00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:29.205
What is he up to?

00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:39.205
You even know how to make desserts?

00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:43.925
I also made the late-night snack...

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:45.605
you had last night.

00:08:51.605 --> 00:08:52.765
So you've made yourself...

00:08:53.005 --> 00:08:54.085
into such an all-rounder...

00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:58.485
just to have fun with men?

00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:01.325
Ever since I was little,

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:03.245
my parents wanted a daughter.

00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:06.325
But they only had me.

00:09:08.405 --> 00:09:09.485
So ever since I was little,

00:09:09.885 --> 00:09:11.325
they raised me as a daughter.

00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:14.285
They wanted me to learn
how to play music and chess,

00:09:14.885 --> 00:09:16.125
do calligraphy, and embroidery.

00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:19.005
You've always treated yourself
like a girl?

00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:23.765
Believe it or not,

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:26.165
I'll show you what a man is.

00:09:28.405 --> 00:09:29.405
It's quite interesting...

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:30.885
to see you get mad.

00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:36.045
None of those men...

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:37.565
in the past...

00:09:37.885 --> 00:09:39.005
has tried my cooking.

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:41.245
Then who has?

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:42.565
Their next boyfriend.

00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:46.365
Chi Cheng.

00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:49.405
Yes.

00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:51.005
It seems like you care
a lot about him.

00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:54.725
Of course.

00:09:55.205 --> 00:09:57.245
After all, we grew up together.

00:09:58.805 --> 00:09:59.805
Later,

00:10:00.085 --> 00:10:01.125
he's even coming to visit.

00:10:02.565 --> 00:10:04.445
Please don't tell him
that I'm staying here.

00:10:04.685 --> 00:10:05.965
I'm begging you. Please don't.

00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:25.325
Xiao Shuai, I can't take it anymore.

00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:29.445
Please come home earlier tomorrow.

00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:00.565
Are you crazy?

00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:02.165
Lower your voice.

00:11:05.445 --> 00:11:07.205
I'm going to check my computer.

00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.085
Don't make a sound.

00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:11.565
Hey.

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:13.125
By the way,

00:11:14.405 --> 00:11:16.405
you're coming back
to your own clinic.

00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:19.285
Why are you acting like a thief?

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:20.805
What do you know?

00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:21.925
If Wu Suo Wei finds out,

00:11:21.925 --> 00:11:22.925
then Chi Cheng will know.

00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:24.205
I can't be too careful.

00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:50.205
Okay.

00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:02.205
Essence?

00:12:12.925 --> 00:12:14.645
On the surface,
you look gentle and refined.

00:12:15.205 --> 00:12:16.205
I didn't expect...

00:12:27.165 --> 00:12:28.165
Yes.

00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:36.285
Go back to our place tonight.

00:12:38.965 --> 00:12:40.085
I suddenly miss my mom.

00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:42.685
I want to spend
one more day with her.

00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:45.845
Now that you mention it,

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:47.805
I haven't been back for a long time.

00:12:51.365 --> 00:12:52.365
I'll go home with you.

00:12:52.965 --> 00:12:53.965
Don't.

00:12:54.045 --> 00:12:55.045
When you go back,

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:56.245
my mom will be suspicious.

00:12:57.365 --> 00:12:58.365
Of what?

00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:02.685
Are you afraid your mom...

00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:05.165
will be able to tell
that I slept with you?

00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:07.285
What are you talking about?

00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:28.565
Xiao Shuai.

00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:30.925
Why aren't you back yet?

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:46.981
Does he really sneak back
in the middle of the night,

00:13:47.005 --> 00:13:48.165
and don't turn on the lights?

00:13:55.845 --> 00:13:56.845
Teacher.

00:14:13.405 --> 00:14:15.005
Did you reject me for two nights...

00:14:15.805 --> 00:14:17.245
just to hug him?

00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:23.245
Why is it you?

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:26.085
Did I disappoint you?

00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:28.525
I...

00:14:29.205 --> 00:14:30.205
No.

00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:37.005
What are you doing? Don't move.

00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:38.405
Stay still.

00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:49.565
Darn it.

00:14:50.165 --> 00:14:51.165
Why is the door open?

00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:55.565
Is there a thief?

00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:11.405
How dare he steal from me?

00:15:11.725 --> 00:15:12.765
Does he have a death wish?

00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:14.925
I'll kill you!

00:15:33.485 --> 00:15:34.485
Why are you still here?

00:15:35.405 --> 00:15:36.405
Do you want to join us?

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:39.125
No.

00:15:39.365 --> 00:15:40.365
Sorry to bother you.

00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:41.805
Carry on.

00:15:41.925 --> 00:15:42.925
Continue.

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.125
Why am I so unlucky?

00:15:48.805 --> 00:15:50.645
Why do I keep bumping into them?

00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.245
They...

00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:57.125
They've already...

00:15:59.405 --> 00:16:00.405
Darn it.

00:16:02.365 --> 00:16:03.365
I'm doomed.

00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:07.765
I'm too ashamed
to meet my master this time.

00:16:11.285 --> 00:16:12.285
That's good.

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.285
Go and pack up.

00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:15.925
Move into our house.

00:16:16.005 --> 00:16:17.925
But we'll still see each other.

00:16:19.205 --> 00:16:20.685
My dignity as a man...

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:26.205
Is your dignity as a man...

00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:28.925
reflected by meeting him at night?

00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:30.845
Do you think I want
to see him at night?

00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:32.765
He's been avoiding me.

00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:35.405
Ask around.
He hasn't made house calls for days.

00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:37.245
I can only wait for him here
at night.

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.165
When was the last time
you talked to him?

00:16:41.885 --> 00:16:42.885
Maybe a week ago.

00:16:50.445 --> 00:16:51.565
It's the sixth day.

00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:54.005
Sixth day?

00:16:55.485 --> 00:16:56.485
It's nothing.

00:16:56.525 --> 00:16:57.525
Give me your phone.

00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:08.365
What are you doing?

00:17:11.805 --> 00:17:12.925
I'll even the score for you.

00:17:13.725 --> 00:17:14.725
What do you mean?

00:17:19.885 --> 00:17:20.885
Teacher.

00:17:20.965 --> 00:17:22.325
Actually, Guo Cheng Yu...

00:17:22.525 --> 00:17:23.725
knew about it a long time ago.

00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:26.205
Guo Cheng Yu!

00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:28.165
Come out, Guo Cheng Yu!

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:31.165
Open the door!

00:17:36.245 --> 00:17:37.245
Why are you here?

00:17:37.405 --> 00:17:38.405
You...

00:17:38.406 --> 00:17:39.845
Why are you dressed like that?

00:17:40.645 --> 00:17:41.645
I just took a shower.

00:17:41.965 --> 00:17:42.965
Isn't that normal?

00:17:44.765 --> 00:17:46.301
Why did you come
to see me at this hour?

00:17:46.325 --> 00:17:47.325
Tell me.

00:17:48.685 --> 00:17:49.685
It's nothing.

00:17:50.925 --> 00:17:51.925
Well...

00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:53.765
I'll get going.

00:17:59.565 --> 00:18:00.925
You didn't come here for anything,

00:18:02.365 --> 00:18:03.565
but I need something from you.

00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:10.605
By the way,

00:18:10.765 --> 00:18:12.045
I found something interesting...

00:18:13.045 --> 00:18:14.765
in your drawer.

00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:16.605
For example,

00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:19.245
this aphrodisiac essence.

00:18:19.645 --> 00:18:20.725
I really like it.

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:22.605
- Give it to me.
- No.

00:18:22.645 --> 00:18:23.645
- Give it to me.
- No.

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:25.564
- Give it to me.
- No...

00:18:25.565 --> 00:18:26.565
No.

00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:34.805
I'm... I'm sorry.

00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:36.805
I... I didn't do it on purpose.

00:19:28.365 --> 00:19:29.365
Meng Tao.

00:19:29.645 --> 00:19:30.645
Meng Tao.

00:19:31.085 --> 00:19:32.525
Meng Tao, don't.

00:19:33.325 --> 00:19:34.485
Why are you doing this to me?

00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:38.365
Meng Tao.

00:19:39.365 --> 00:19:40.365
Meng Tao.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:41.805
I feel hot.

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:44.165
Meng Tao.

00:19:45.165 --> 00:19:46.165
I feel hot.

00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:49.445
I feel hot.

00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:52.605
Don't do this.

00:19:53.565 --> 00:19:54.565
Don't act this way.

00:19:54.565 --> 00:19:55.565
Don't do this.

00:19:58.125 --> 00:19:59.125
Don't be like this.

00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:31.605
Apart from a slight headache,

00:20:33.005 --> 00:20:34.685
I don't really feel unwell.

00:20:47.565 --> 00:20:51.085
(Drink some when you wake up,
it's good for the stomach)

00:21:02.085 --> 00:21:03.085
Mrs. Wu.

00:21:07.045 --> 00:21:08.525
Mrs. Wu, what's wrong?
Are you unwell?

00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:11.365
I'm fine. This happens all the time.

00:21:11.885 --> 00:21:14.365
Xiao Chi,
what brings you here today?

00:21:14.845 --> 00:21:16.061
I bought some supplements for you,

00:21:16.085 --> 00:21:17.085
so I brought them over.

00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:19.405
Look at you. You always
bring something when you come.

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.445
All right. Let's talk inside.

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:24.845
Mrs. Wu.

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.885
Let's go.
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:28.685
- Come on.
- It's okay.

00:21:29.045 --> 00:21:30.084
I just need to take some medicine.

00:21:30.085 --> 00:21:31.845
Your health is important.
Let's do a checkup.

00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:34.565
- Mrs. Wu, slowly.
- Okay.

00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:43.565
So...

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:45.165
you've been staying...

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:46.926
at Guo Cheng Yu's place
in the past few days?

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:49.965
Guo Cheng Yu is a troublemaker.

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:51.325
If it weren't for him,

00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:52.845
I would have completed my mission.

00:21:53.525 --> 00:21:54.525
He even purposely told me...

00:21:54.526 --> 00:21:55.926
that you two didn't sleep together.

00:21:56.165 --> 00:21:57.925
So I only dared
to stay at his place.

00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:01.405
Mission?

00:22:02.045 --> 00:22:03.045
What mission?

00:22:04.725 --> 00:22:05.725
You still don't know?

00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:12.085
Forget it. I'll be honest with you.

00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:14.685
Chi Cheng gave me an ultimatum...

00:22:15.165 --> 00:22:16.405
to let you willingly...

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:18.285
sleep with him within five days.

00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:19.565
Otherwise,

00:22:19.566 --> 00:22:20.965
I'll be the one in trouble.

00:22:21.605 --> 00:22:23.125
In the end, I didn't accomplish it.

00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:25.165
I didn't dare to contact you either.

00:22:28.565 --> 00:22:30.045
Chi Cheng told you to set me up?

00:22:32.285 --> 00:22:33.285
Da Wei.

00:22:33.765 --> 00:22:35.365
You're not mad at me, are you?

00:22:43.645 --> 00:22:44.645
It's okay.

00:22:45.045 --> 00:22:46.045
I can't blame you.

00:22:46.725 --> 00:22:48.165
After all, you were forced to do it.

00:22:48.805 --> 00:22:50.925
If I were you, I wouldn't be able
to handle it either.

00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:57.405
I just regret it.

00:22:58.045 --> 00:23:00.565
Why did I fall for it so easily?

00:23:01.725 --> 00:23:02.725
The two of us...

00:23:02.765 --> 00:23:04.005
are just small fries.

00:23:04.445 --> 00:23:06.045
Chi Cheng is a big fish.

00:23:06.605 --> 00:23:07.845
Guo Cheng Yu...

00:23:08.085 --> 00:23:09.285
is an old fox.

00:23:12.325 --> 00:23:13.325
Tell me.

00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:15.005
Should I take this opportunity...

00:23:15.245 --> 00:23:17.485
to tell him why I approached him
back then?

00:23:18.245 --> 00:23:20.165
This way, he'll apologize,

00:23:20.445 --> 00:23:21.605
and I'll admit to my mistake.

00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:23.245
We're even now.

00:23:24.805 --> 00:23:26.365
This is indeed a good opportunity.

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.061
After getting rid
of this mental struggle,

00:23:28.085 --> 00:23:29.565
you'll have nothing to worry about.

00:23:39.485 --> 00:23:40.965
In the past few days...

00:23:43.525 --> 00:23:45.485
that you've been staying
at Guo Cheng Yu's house,

00:23:45.965 --> 00:23:47.485
didn't you two...

00:23:49.685 --> 00:23:51.125
Don't overthink it.

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:52.765
We didn't.

00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:56.405
Actually,

00:23:57.765 --> 00:23:58.765
I don't think...

00:23:58.766 --> 00:24:00.125
Guo Cheng Yu likes me.

00:24:01.765 --> 00:24:02.765
When you asked him
for the snake,

00:24:02.766 --> 00:24:04.221
he just gave it to you
without hesitation.

00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:05.245
When I was injured,

00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:06.581
he didn't take the chance
to snatch the snakes either.

00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:08.365
Instead, he took me
to the hospital with you.

00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:10.485
Doesn't that prove
that he likes you?

00:24:10.645 --> 00:24:12.005
He gave me the snake I wanted...

00:24:12.205 --> 00:24:13.325
because he knew...

00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:15.445
I was doing it to save
Chi Cheng's snakes.

00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:17.005
He took you to the hospital...

00:24:17.045 --> 00:24:18.965
because he didn't want
Chi Cheng to feel anxious.

00:24:19.205 --> 00:24:20.205
Look.

00:24:20.205 --> 00:24:21.205
It's obvious.

00:24:21.325 --> 00:24:22.765
I'm not the one he likes.

00:24:25.165 --> 00:24:26.245
What are you trying to say?

00:24:29.565 --> 00:24:30.565
I think...

00:24:31.365 --> 00:24:33.685
Guo Cheng Yu likes Chi Cheng.

00:24:35.885 --> 00:24:37.725
The snakes I asked for back then...

00:24:37.885 --> 00:24:39.165
were all rare species.

00:24:40.085 --> 00:24:41.085
Guo Cheng Yu has...

00:24:41.245 --> 00:24:42.405
whatever snake Chi Cheng has.

00:24:42.765 --> 00:24:43.765
Also,

00:24:43.766 --> 00:24:46.085
it's exactly like the snake garden
Chi Cheng has.

00:24:46.805 --> 00:24:47.805
Let me tell you.

00:24:47.806 --> 00:24:48.981
For every snake Chi Cheng has,

00:24:49.005 --> 00:24:50.245
Young Master Guo has a copy.

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:51.405
Shut up.

00:24:52.965 --> 00:24:54.045
Do you know why?

00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:57.325
Also,

00:24:57.445 --> 00:24:58.445
don't you think...

00:24:58.485 --> 00:25:00.485
their love triangle...

00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:01.885
is a bit strange?

00:25:03.165 --> 00:25:04.165
Strange?

00:25:04.445 --> 00:25:05.445
What's strange about it?

00:25:05.925 --> 00:25:07.485
They've been fighting
for seven years...

00:25:07.605 --> 00:25:08.925
because of Wang Shuo.

00:25:09.485 --> 00:25:10.685
But have you heard anyone...

00:25:11.005 --> 00:25:13.205
look for Wang Shuo
during those seven years?

00:25:14.405 --> 00:25:15.405
Chi Cheng didn't...

00:25:15.565 --> 00:25:16.565
because he hates him.

00:25:16.685 --> 00:25:18.285
But why didn't Guo Cheng Yu
look for him?

00:25:20.245 --> 00:25:21.485
I guess that makes sense.

00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:24.645
If Guo Cheng Yu
really liked Wang Shuo,

00:25:24.925 --> 00:25:26.845
they should have
gotten together back then.

00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:28.261
That's where the issue lies.

00:25:28.285 --> 00:25:30.525
Not only didn't Guo Cheng Yu
get together with Wang Shuo,

00:25:30.805 --> 00:25:33.925
he thought of all sorts of reasons
to compete with Chi Cheng.

00:25:34.725 --> 00:25:36.285
So you think...

00:25:37.005 --> 00:25:38.445
Guo Cheng Yu likes Chi Cheng?

00:25:39.845 --> 00:25:40.845
That's not all.

00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:42.405
I also noticed...

00:25:42.525 --> 00:25:43.781
that on the day we took the snakes,

00:25:43.805 --> 00:25:46.085
when Guo Cheng Yu
and Chi Cheng were fighting,

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.445
Chi Cheng was clearly winning.

00:25:48.885 --> 00:25:51.005
When he was about to punch
Guo Cheng Yu in the face,

00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:52.125
why...

00:25:52.605 --> 00:25:54.245
couldn't he do it?

00:25:55.205 --> 00:25:56.205
That's not right.

00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:58.965
Why are you saying
Chi Cheng couldn't do it?

00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:00.485
What are you trying to say?

00:26:02.485 --> 00:26:03.485
I think...

00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:05.085
Chi Cheng...

00:26:05.086 --> 00:26:07.085
likes Guo Cheng Yu too.

00:26:13.765 --> 00:26:14.765
Xiao Shuai.

00:26:15.485 --> 00:26:16.485
Chi Cheng...

00:26:16.845 --> 00:26:17.845
and I...

00:26:24.205 --> 00:26:25.205
I get it now.

00:26:26.045 --> 00:26:27.045
You just want to prove...

00:26:27.046 --> 00:26:28.725
that Guo Cheng Yu doesn't like you.

00:26:29.125 --> 00:26:30.645
That's why you're being
so creative...

00:26:30.805 --> 00:26:32.245
that you're vividly
imagining things.

00:26:33.645 --> 00:26:35.885
It's because
you're still inexperienced.

00:26:36.285 --> 00:26:38.365
You'll understand in the future.

00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:43.485
Here.

00:26:43.725 --> 00:26:45.325
Have some milk.
It's good for your brain.

00:26:47.925 --> 00:26:48.925
Xiao Chi.

00:26:49.485 --> 00:26:50.725
Thank you for today.

00:26:51.165 --> 00:26:53.485
You spent so much time going
to the hospital with me.

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:56.125
Mrs. Wu,
you really don't have to thank me.

00:26:56.845 --> 00:26:58.125
I'm Da Qiong's colleague.

00:26:58.365 --> 00:26:59.525
I should help you.

00:27:00.845 --> 00:27:01.845
Here.

00:27:01.845 --> 00:27:02.845
Have a seat.

00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:11.245
Xiao Chi.

00:27:11.525 --> 00:27:12.525
Let me ask you.

00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:13.565
Is Da Qiong...

00:27:13.725 --> 00:27:15.725
performing well in the company?

00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:17.045
Yes.

00:27:17.725 --> 00:27:18.725
Have some water, Mrs. Wu.

00:27:20.645 --> 00:27:21.645
The company's boss...

00:27:22.165 --> 00:27:23.165
really likes him.

00:27:27.485 --> 00:27:29.645
Da Qiong is an honest man.

00:27:29.965 --> 00:27:31.765
He's not cunning.

00:27:32.445 --> 00:27:34.165
In this day and age,

00:27:34.485 --> 00:27:37.205
honest people
can't make a lot of money.

00:27:37.965 --> 00:27:39.685
They can only make a living.

00:27:40.885 --> 00:27:42.085
Da Qiong...

00:27:42.565 --> 00:27:43.605
has long mutated.

00:27:43.805 --> 00:27:44.805
Xiao Chi.

00:27:45.285 --> 00:27:46.525
Are you dating?

00:27:48.285 --> 00:27:49.285
Yes.

00:27:50.765 --> 00:27:52.445
Young men like you...

00:27:52.885 --> 00:27:54.445
are the most likable.

00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:56.165
You're bold in words and action.

00:27:57.205 --> 00:27:58.765
Unlike Da Qiong.

00:28:00.285 --> 00:28:02.165
He had a girlfriend for three years.

00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:03.965
And they broke up.

00:28:04.605 --> 00:28:05.605
Tell me.

00:28:05.885 --> 00:28:07.165
Shouldn't I feel anxious?

00:28:08.365 --> 00:28:10.285
He had a girlfriend for three years?

00:28:12.085 --> 00:28:13.085
That's right.

00:28:13.405 --> 00:28:14.405
Look.

00:28:14.406 --> 00:28:17.245
Da Qiong even sent me a photo
of them before.

00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:18.565
I'll find it for you.

00:28:18.645 --> 00:28:20.845
(Da Qiong)

00:28:26.925 --> 00:28:28.644
Why... Why can't I find it anymore?

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:30.325
Mrs. Wu, the photo is not important.

00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:32.765
They dated for so long.

00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:34.725
Why did they break up?

00:28:36.765 --> 00:28:37.965
Da Qiong told me...

00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:40.525
they're not compatible.

00:28:42.365 --> 00:28:43.885
I know in my heart...

00:28:44.445 --> 00:28:45.564
that the girl...

00:28:45.565 --> 00:28:47.165
dislikes us for being poor.

00:28:49.325 --> 00:28:50.325
At that time,

00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:52.485
they were already
talking about marriage.

00:28:52.845 --> 00:28:55.245
She was already at the door,

00:28:57.725 --> 00:28:58.725
but she went home.

00:29:02.045 --> 00:29:03.165
After that,

00:29:03.285 --> 00:29:04.285
Da Qiong...

00:29:04.965 --> 00:29:06.645
never mentioned her to me again.

00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:09.925
Mrs. Wu.

00:29:10.085 --> 00:29:11.565
It's all in the past now.

00:29:11.765 --> 00:29:12.925
Don't think about it anymore.

00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:15.125
By the way,

00:29:15.645 --> 00:29:16.645
these are the medicines.

00:29:17.365 --> 00:29:18.965
This one must be taken
three times a day.

00:29:20.165 --> 00:29:21.365
This one twice a day.

00:29:21.645 --> 00:29:22.845
They're all taken after meals.

00:29:24.325 --> 00:29:25.845
Well, get some rest first.

00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:27.125
I'll get going.

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:28.525
- Okay?
- Thank you.

00:29:28.645 --> 00:29:30.565
No worries, Mrs. Wu.
I won't disturb you anymore.

00:29:38.885 --> 00:29:39.885
I remember...

00:29:40.165 --> 00:29:42.565
Da Qiong sent me a photo.

00:29:43.165 --> 00:29:47.764
(Da Qiong)

00:29:47.765 --> 00:29:49.165
It's right here.

00:29:52.445 --> 00:29:53.725
Get the medicines based on this.

00:29:54.005 --> 00:29:55.325
Just take it as prescribed.

00:29:56.165 --> 00:29:57.165
Dr. Jiang.

00:29:57.365 --> 00:29:58.365
Xiao Zhuang.

00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:00.245
I brought you some fruits.

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:02.405
So it didn't leave a scar, right?

00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:07.165
Look. There's no trace
of it anymore.

00:30:08.365 --> 00:30:10.445
That's good. From now on,
take good care of yourself.

00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:11.845
Stop thinking about that jerk.

00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:13.365
What are you chatting about?

00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:20.725
I'll go wash some fruits.

00:30:21.205 --> 00:30:22.565
Don't...

00:30:25.165 --> 00:30:27.685
Dr. Jiang, why are you feeling shy?

00:30:29.205 --> 00:30:30.205
Who?

00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:32.165
Who's feeling shy?

00:30:33.085 --> 00:30:34.485
You have bad eyesight, don't you?

00:30:35.885 --> 00:30:36.885
Yes.

00:30:37.005 --> 00:30:38.005
I'm slow-witted.

00:30:38.405 --> 00:30:39.565
If you have bad eyesight,

00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:40.805
go to a big hospital.

00:30:41.765 --> 00:30:42.965
Don't get a consultation here.

00:30:48.365 --> 00:30:50.565
Do you know how troubled
I've been in the past few days?

00:30:50.805 --> 00:30:53.005
I thought your ex-lover
was coming back.

00:30:53.325 --> 00:30:54.685
Do you know how upset I was?

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:02.605
I'm a terrible person.

00:31:04.285 --> 00:31:05.285
I'm sorry.

00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:11.605
I've always thought you're a man...

00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:13.325
who's magnanimous and broad-minded.

00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:14.981
I didn't expect you
to be such a hypocrite!

00:31:15.005 --> 00:31:17.205
You instigated Jiang Xiao Shuai
to trick me, didn't you?

00:31:24.325 --> 00:31:25.885
Don't you ever lie?

00:31:27.245 --> 00:31:28.525
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:31:29.965 --> 00:31:30.965
All right.

00:31:31.365 --> 00:31:32.365
I admit.

00:31:32.445 --> 00:31:33.445
I approached you...

00:31:34.085 --> 00:31:35.085
because of Yue Yue.

00:31:35.365 --> 00:31:36.365
All right.

00:31:39.325 --> 00:31:40.325
We're even now.

00:31:48.205 --> 00:31:49.205
When he comes back later,

00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:51.325
I'll officially attack him.

00:31:51.845 --> 00:31:53.445
When he's utterly embarrassed,

00:31:53.525 --> 00:31:55.885
I'll tell him why I approached him.

00:31:56.005 --> 00:31:59.085
That way, I can show him
my magnanimity...

00:31:59.365 --> 00:32:02.405
and braveness
in taking responsibility as a man.

00:32:02.925 --> 00:32:03.925
That's what I'll do.

00:32:12.685 --> 00:32:13.805
What's your pose for?

00:32:14.965 --> 00:32:15.965
Have you eaten?

00:32:17.245 --> 00:32:18.405
I haven't.

00:32:19.485 --> 00:32:20.485
That's good.

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:22.485
I bought some food downstairs.

00:32:22.645 --> 00:32:23.645
Eat it while it's hot.

00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:25.045
No.

00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:30.565
It's up to you if you'll eat or not.

00:32:55.485 --> 00:32:56.485
This won't do.

00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:58.045
I need to get into the mood.

00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:21.645
Here.

00:33:22.365 --> 00:33:23.365
Try it on.

00:33:26.165 --> 00:33:27.165
When did you buy it?

00:33:28.685 --> 00:33:30.365
When I was buying clothes
for my mom today,

00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:32.365
I bought one for you too.

00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:37.485
Why didn't you buy it today,

00:33:37.765 --> 00:33:38.805
of all days?

00:33:39.245 --> 00:33:40.661
I was finally starting
to get fired up.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.885
This appeal to the emotions...

00:33:42.045 --> 00:33:43.045
blew out my fire.

00:33:45.125 --> 00:33:46.445
I'm too softhearted.

00:33:58.445 --> 00:33:59.445
Are you done?

00:33:59.725 --> 00:34:00.725
Yes.

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.205
Not bad.

00:34:03.285 --> 00:34:04.285
It fits you quite well.

00:34:05.005 --> 00:34:06.005
Okay.

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:08.645
Don't take it off.

00:34:09.685 --> 00:34:10.685
Just wear it.

00:34:11.525 --> 00:34:12.565
It's nice.

00:34:13.645 --> 00:34:15.045
I have good taste.

00:34:19.765 --> 00:34:20.765
What are you doing?

00:34:27.805 --> 00:34:29.245
- Did you meet Xiao Shuai?
- Yes.

00:34:30.285 --> 00:34:31.285
Did he tell you...

00:34:32.525 --> 00:34:33.845
that I asked him to persuade you?

00:34:34.165 --> 00:34:35.165
Persuade?

00:34:36.005 --> 00:34:37.645
That's not persuasion,
but manipulation!

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:43.284
So you think
I'm a person who will do anything...

00:34:43.285 --> 00:34:44.485
to get what I want, right?

00:34:44.565 --> 00:34:45.565
Yes.

00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:47.565
You said you'd be patient with me.

00:34:47.805 --> 00:34:50.061
You said you wouldn't mind
when I'll think things through.

00:34:50.085 --> 00:34:51.605
And you said you wouldn't force me.

00:34:51.685 --> 00:34:53.605
But you secretly
threatened Jiang Xiao Shuai...

00:34:53.685 --> 00:34:55.204
and forced him to make me do it.

00:34:55.205 --> 00:34:57.165
Chi Cheng, I thought
you were a man...

00:34:57.285 --> 00:34:58.501
who's magnanimous and broad-minded.

00:34:58.525 --> 00:35:00.365
But I didn't expect you
to be such a hypocrite!

00:35:05.165 --> 00:35:06.165
Do you know...

00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:08.525
how troubled I've been
in the past few days?

00:35:09.485 --> 00:35:11.525
I thought your ex-lover
was coming back.

00:35:11.885 --> 00:35:14.125
Do you know how upset I was
in the past few days?

00:35:14.165 --> 00:35:16.285
You used such cheap tricks
to provoke me...

00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:17.844
and built all your happiness...

00:35:17.845 --> 00:35:18.965
on my pain.

00:35:19.045 --> 00:35:20.965
I regret it so much now.

00:35:22.685 --> 00:35:24.925
I shouldn't have listened
to Jiang Xiao Shuai back then.

00:35:25.045 --> 00:35:26.485
I should have ignored you back then!

00:35:30.325 --> 00:35:31.405
You were ridiculed so much.

00:35:31.605 --> 00:35:32.781
You can't take it anymore, right?

00:35:32.805 --> 00:35:33.805
Come at me if you can.

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.805
Curse me. Swear at me.

00:35:36.005 --> 00:35:37.685
After that, I can show you
my trump card.

00:35:40.525 --> 00:35:41.525
I admit it.

00:35:43.845 --> 00:35:44.845
It's all my fault.

00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:54.485
I was too impatient.

00:35:55.045 --> 00:35:56.765
I was afraid that
if we delayed it too much,

00:35:56.925 --> 00:35:58.485
you'd overthink it.

00:36:02.325 --> 00:36:03.485
I went to Jiang Xiao Shuai...

00:36:03.685 --> 00:36:05.205
because he knows you the best.

00:36:05.565 --> 00:36:06.965
That's why I used this method.

00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:10.765
Of course,

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:15.965
it was a bit too forceful.

00:36:17.765 --> 00:36:19.205
I don't feel good about it either.

00:36:22.365 --> 00:36:23.365
Darn it.

00:36:23.645 --> 00:36:25.365
Why doesn't he play by the rules?

00:36:25.765 --> 00:36:27.485
How could I tell him
about Yue Yue now?

00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:30.245
If I come clean,

00:36:30.925 --> 00:36:32.845
will I end up worse than Wang Shuo?

00:36:44.685 --> 00:36:45.885
Are you still mad at me?

00:36:49.085 --> 00:36:50.085
Do you...

00:36:50.325 --> 00:36:51.565
still hate Wang Shuo?

00:36:54.205 --> 00:36:55.845
Why are you bringing him up
for no reason?

00:36:57.165 --> 00:36:58.165
Do you...

00:36:58.165 --> 00:36:59.165
care about him?

00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:01.405
I told you.

00:37:02.645 --> 00:37:04.845
What I care about
is what happened back then,

00:37:05.645 --> 00:37:06.645
not him.

00:37:07.165 --> 00:37:08.165
What if...

00:37:09.005 --> 00:37:10.645
he comes back
and give you an explanation?

00:37:10.925 --> 00:37:11.925
Will you forgive him?

00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:14.485
No.

00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:17.005
But what if
he really had his reasons?

00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:19.525
What happened, happened.

00:37:20.445 --> 00:37:21.445
I, Chi Cheng,

00:37:22.205 --> 00:37:23.845
hate it when people lie to me.

00:37:30.045 --> 00:37:31.205
I... I also...

00:37:31.645 --> 00:37:32.725
lied to you a lot, right?

00:37:33.005 --> 00:37:34.405
But you didn't do anything to me.

00:37:38.485 --> 00:37:40.445
Within my control,

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:41.725
those...

00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:42.925
aren't lies.

00:37:43.725 --> 00:37:45.205
Just little schemes, at most.

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.765
But if it's beyond my control,

00:37:49.925 --> 00:37:51.325
and you keep me in the dark,

00:37:52.485 --> 00:37:54.205
that's what you really call lying.

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:04.965
What's wrong?

00:38:09.565 --> 00:38:10.565
What?

00:38:11.445 --> 00:38:12.445
Have you lied to me?

00:38:17.165 --> 00:38:18.165
How?

00:38:21.765 --> 00:38:22.765
Actually,

00:38:23.845 --> 00:38:25.565
I had an ulterior motive...

00:38:27.325 --> 00:38:28.605
when I approached you back then.

00:38:34.965 --> 00:38:35.965
What ulterior motive?

00:38:42.205 --> 00:38:43.805
(Bonus Clip)

00:38:44.285 --> 00:38:45.885
Daily necessities?

00:39:01.685 --> 00:39:02.685
But Sir,

00:39:03.805 --> 00:39:05.445
does the essence
you mentioned just now...

00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:06.885
really work?

00:39:07.325 --> 00:39:08.645
I'll buy a bottle for you to try.

00:39:11.245 --> 00:39:12.245
Just wait.

00:39:13.245 --> 00:39:14.885
You'll come in handy one day.
