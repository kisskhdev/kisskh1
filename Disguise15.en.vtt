WEBVTT

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280
Alright, alright.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.695
The drug is working.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.320
Looks like that guy is
overwhelmed with desire.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.920
The people you arranged
are working hard too.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.280
Of course.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.920
I paid a lot, so they
have to be professional.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.479
I hired two.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960
There's one more.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.375
Qingyan.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.479
Qingyan, are you okay?

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:39.119
You guys...

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:43.055
Gao Xing, what are you
doing? Are you crazy?

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.640
Shh, there's surveillance.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.520
Surveillance?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.320
Look.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.799
The second one is here too.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.799
That guy Gao is really lucky with women.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.719
Too bad this lousy
surveillance has no sound.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.640
Let him enjoy himself for now.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.399
Tomorrow, I'll ruin his reputation.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:03.759
President Su, you're brilliant.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.159
No wonder he's the man I have my eye on.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:11.120
Let's have a drink to celebrate.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.640
Cheers.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:21.415
So it was Su Zhengdong who set you up.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.200
You played along and came on purpose.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.560
Of course.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.760
Otherwise, do you think
I'd fall for his honey trap?

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.456
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.920
Yeah, even Qingyan got
jealous because of you.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840
Who got jealous?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.215
I didn't.

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:43.040
I was just worried he might go astray.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.096
That's why I came to check on him.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.776
I wasn't jealous.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.719
I can handle this little thing by myself.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Telling you guys

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.616
was just to avoid any mistakes.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.040
So what do we do now?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.439
We can't keep pretending
like this forever, can we?

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.079
Don't worry.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.280
The people next door should
be falling for it about now.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.280
Another drink.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.439
Another drink.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120
Mr. Su.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.319
My whole body

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.856
feels so hot.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.759
Honestly, I'm hot too.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.455
Mr. Su, I want...

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.479
Okay.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Okay.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.919
There really is a camera here.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.800
Su Zhengdong's methods are so despicable.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.400
What are you planning to do next?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080
Nothing.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.200
Just wait and watch the show tomorrow.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.719
What happened last night?

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.680
Why did that drink hit so hard?

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.560
Who knows?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.080
It was all a blur.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.279
Just don't let it affect the important stuff.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.439
The important stuff.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
The important stuff.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.520
Where is he? Why did he leave?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.319
If he left, he left.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.759
As long as we have the video, it's fine.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.097
It's here, it's here.

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:30.439
The video, the video.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.719
The video.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.319
With this in hand,

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.496
let's see how happy he is.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.760
How can he compete with me now?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.240
Hurry up and get ready
to go to the company.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:43.919
Business comes first.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.319
Everyone is here.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.199
I have an announcement to make.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.415
Deputy General Manager Su Zhengdong,

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.976
has acted unethically and
embezzled company assets.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.575
He has betrayed the company's interests.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.800
He is dismissed effective today.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
From now on,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.199
the position of Deputy General
Manager will be taken over by Gao Xing.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520
Wait a minute.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.240
I don't agree.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.680
I've been at Qingmu for so many years.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.319
I've always been loyal to the company.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.399
I've worked diligently.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.976
Even if I haven't made great
achievements, I've at least worked hard.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Why should I be fired?

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:25.399
Su Zhengdong.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.536
Qingyan is only giving you face
because you're her fourth uncle.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.976
That's the only reason she's being polite.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.935
You've failed your
performance reviews every year.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.776
You even colluded with the
Song family for your own benefit.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.136
You sold the company's secret formula.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.639
What's wrong with firing you?

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.319
That's nonsense!

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:39.839
What secret formula?

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.839
There's no evidence for any of that.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.959
But this guy Gao,

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.680
relies on being the CEO's husband

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.720
to do whatever he wants in the company.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800
He's morally corrupt.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.000
Someone like him isn't qualified
to be the company's vice president.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.880
President Su, I want to report something.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.879
Gao Xing has harassed
and flirted with me at work.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.319
He even tried to force me
to go to a hotel with him.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.536
He said he's the CEO's husband.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.200
He claims his word is law in the company.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.920
If I don't agree,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.120
he'll kick me out of the company.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:10.839
Oh no!

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:14.255
So that's the kind of person he is.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.855
How could something like this happen?

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:16.777
You really can't tell just by looking.

00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:17.959
Did everyone hear that?

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.120
It's not just Secretary Xu.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.096
As the president's husband,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.855
he actually went out
looking for other women.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.016
Booking hotel rooms.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.519
Partying every night.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.576
This is simply disgraceful.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.879
A beast in human clothing.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.839
Amazing, just amazing.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.959
You're really good at turning the tables.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.615
But you say I party every night,

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.639
and that I'm immoral.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:44.199
Do you have any proof?

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.216
Happy, aren't you?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.055
Still hoping for luck when
you're at the end of the road.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.720
Of course I have proof.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.600
It's right here on my
computer's hard drive.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.360
As soon as I hit enter to send it,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.240
everyone in the company will get it.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.376
Happy?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.016
I'm giving you one last chance.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.800
If you want to save any face at all,

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.600
resign on your own.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.519
And get out of here quietly.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:08.879
Otherwise,

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.879
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920
Is that so?

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.759
Then go ahead and send it.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.559
Let everyone see for themselves.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.600
Don't hold back on my account.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.279
You...

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
Qingyan.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.040
Don't blame your fourth
uncle for not warning you.

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.959
If this video gets released,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.000
you'll lose all your dignity as a wife.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.480
You can still cut your losses now.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.759
Fire him immediately.

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:40.079
Never hire him again.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.056
Hey, no rush.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.896
Fourth uncle, I think.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920
Gao Xing is right.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.279
I want to see the video too.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.199
How about

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480
just release it?

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:48.839
Wait, you...

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.120
Do you all realize

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.680
if I release this video,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.600
it'll be a huge bombshell.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800
The consequences

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.976
can you handle them?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Stop dawdling.

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.576
We told you to post it, so do it.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.295
You...

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.175
Are you going to post it or not?

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.600
I...

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.816
If you have it, hurry up and post it.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.000
Everyone's waiting to see.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.199
Fine, fine, fine.

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.199
Alright, alright, alright.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:08.519
Okay.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.000
You want to embarrass yourselves, right?

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:12.600
Then I'll help you with that.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.199
Secretary Xu.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560
Send it for me.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.279
Happy.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.600
Did you see that?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.855
This is what happens when you
go against me, Su Zhengdong.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:36.879
Regret it now, don't you?

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.319
It's too late.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.520
What you wanted me to see.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.920
Isn't this it?

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.519
What?

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.079
How...

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.199
How could this be?

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.056
Stop watching.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.136
All of you, stop watching.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Stop watching.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.000
How... how

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.456
I clearly recorded your video.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.480
How is it mine?

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.360
Alright, Gao.

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:11.560
You set me up.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560
That's right.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.720
I did set you up.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.800
So who is it now

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.439
who's humiliating themselves?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.519
I'm going to fight you!

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.040
Disgraceful, shameless!

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.137
Guards!

00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:29.600
Drag this shameless couple out!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Done.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.799
All done.

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:43.519
That was satisfying, really satisfying.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.639
Did you see their faces just now?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.320
It was so cathartic.

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.297
Exactly.

00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:50.296
They totally deserved it,
brought it on themselves.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320
Yeah.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.039
But I'm really curious.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:58.519
How exactly did you manage

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.936
to swap the video without
my fourth uncle noticing?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.255
Yeah, they were the
ones who tried to drug you.

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.080
How did it end up backfiring on them?

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:06.919
Come on, tell us how you did it.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:10.360
That's a secret.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.879
I can't reveal it.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.576
I'm here.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.296
Got it.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.320
Bluebird is in position.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.440
Sir.

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:38.079
The wine you ordered has arrived.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:40.559
Just leave it here.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.735
I've already served the guest.

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.519
Ladies, you can clock out now.

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.600
Piece of cake.

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.399
Young master.

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.120
I've got news about Qingmu.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.576
Their product is already finished.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.760
It's about to hit the market.

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:19.879
Bastard.

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:22.600
All my cosmetics companies
are barely surviving.

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.240
But they're thriving.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440
No way.

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:27.879
If I'm struggling,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.360
they shouldn't have it easy either.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840
Pass down my orders.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.799
Tell all media partners working with
the Song family to completely block them.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.456
I want to make sure not a single
pill of his rejuvenation product sells.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.480
Yes, sir.
