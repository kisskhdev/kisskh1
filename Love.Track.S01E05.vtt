WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:15.451

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:26.747
(Kim Yoon Hye)

00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:27.881
Hello?

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:30.984
Honey, do you know what today is?

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:31.819
Today?

00:00:33.654 --> 00:00:36.256
I don't know.

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:37.424
It's our 100th day together.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.028
Time flies, right?
Feels like we just met yesterday.

00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:42.563
I see.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.100
One-hundredth day.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.901
I bought a present for you.

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:48.902
I miss you.

00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:49.870
Should I come by later?

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:53.107
Are you feeling really sick?

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:55.642
No, I'm fine.

00:00:57.344 --> 00:01:01.115
Actually, right now, I'm...

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:02.149
Yes, sir?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.818
Honey, I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:06.654
I love you.

00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:07.554
Yeah.

00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:26.573
Okay, who's carrying the casket?

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:27.775
Dad's casket?

00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:31.078
My mom and I will.

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:33.047
Caskets are very heavy.

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:34.815
You'll need at least four people.

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.185
And spouses and children
aren't supposed to carry it.

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:39.820
Why not?

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.122
There are proper customs.

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:44.825
The chief mourner can't do everything
including carrying the casket.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.527
A funeral...

00:01:46.527 --> 00:01:49.463
isn't something
women can just handle on their own.

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:51.732
You really know nothing.

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:53.767
Isn't there a grown man around?

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.170
A husband or a boyfriend? Anyone?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.906
No, you should wear it on the left.

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:01.675
And have you chosen
the shroud and the casket?

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:05.713
The price differences all have reasons.

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:09.650
Sure, people say the deceased won't know,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.486
but in the end,
funerals are for the living.

00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:16.290
That doesn't mean I'm saying
you should choose the expensive one.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.825
Have you booked the crematorium?

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:19.259
What time is it?

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:20.828
What about the hearse?

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.229
Is it a bus or a limousine?

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.197
Excuse me.

00:02:23.197 --> 00:02:26.533
How many meals and helpers
should we prepare?

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:29.903
You don't need too many. Extras cost more.

00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:31.672
Shall we prepare about 30 servings?

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.273
One helper should be enough.

00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:34.441
Excuse me!

00:02:37.578 --> 00:02:38.679
Why are you raising your voice?

00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:42.182
This may be your job,

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:43.884
but it's the first time for my mom and me.

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:48.188
It's the first time my dad died,
and the first time her husband died.

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:53.627
So we'll decide things one by one,
and let you know.

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:54.528
Okay?

00:03:00.234 --> 00:03:01.001
All right.

00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:04.672
If you need people to carry the casket,
let me know.

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:09.777
Why does he keep talking down to me?

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.117
Nothing about this is easy.

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:19.887
I'll take care of everything.

00:03:23.624 --> 00:03:25.592
Are there friends
who could help carry the casket?

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:28.362
It's early morning on a weekday.
Who would come?

00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:29.997
I don't want to ask and get criticized.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.169
Should I call his friends?

00:03:36.203 --> 00:03:38.605
Did anyone ever visit Dad
at the nursing hospital?

00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:41.008
Let's just pay for it.

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.911
I make money to avoid asking favors.

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:48.949
I glanced at the price list earlier,

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.218
and it's 200 dollars per person.

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:56.623
They're such vultures.

00:03:57.324 --> 00:04:01.695
(No Father)

00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:05.866
(My Father's Funeral)

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:40.601
Han Jung Min?

00:04:44.204 --> 00:04:45.139
Hey.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.574
Why are you here?

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.411
Don't say that.

00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:52.046
Jung Min is much older than you.

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:56.250
Get out.

00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:58.352
I said, get out.

00:04:58.352 --> 00:04:59.653
Soo Ah.

00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:03.824
I called him to help carry the casket.

00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:06.527
Why would he do that?

00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:09.596
I can't believe you actually came.

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.764
If you had any shame...

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:12.366
I came to say goodbye one last time.

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:16.203
He loved hiking with me the most,
remember?

00:05:18.572 --> 00:05:19.573
Yes.

00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:21.408
All right.

00:05:23.377 --> 00:05:24.244
Honey.

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.781
The son you cherished has come.

00:05:29.817 --> 00:05:30.718
Father.

00:05:32.953 --> 00:05:34.254
Your son is here.

00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:36.690
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:42.796
Soo Ah, he's happy.

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:45.199
He looks like he's smiling.

00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:50.104
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:56.844
Soo Ah.

00:05:58.045 --> 00:05:58.946
Soo Ah.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.748
Choi Soo Ah.

00:06:02.916 --> 00:06:04.051
Why are you here?

00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:06.987
Don't tell me
you still have feelings for me.

00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:09.790
You cheated, and now you have regrets?

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.724
Hey.

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:14.328
We didn't date for a year or two.
We were together for ten years.

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:16.964
And what, "your son?"

00:06:16.964 --> 00:06:19.566
"He liked hiking with me?" I can't even.

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:21.301
I seriously can't believe this.

00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:24.605
I said I didn't want to get married,
and you went on a blind date.

00:06:24.605 --> 00:06:27.374
Does the person you're seeing now
know you're here?

00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:30.010
You know this is unfair to her too, right?

00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:36.984
I'm sorry I went without telling you.

00:06:40.554 --> 00:06:43.524
This isn't the time for excuses,
but you know my mom.

00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:47.061
If I hadn't gone,
she would've said awful things to you.

00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.028
So...

00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:50.431
I tried to handle it myself.

00:06:51.865 --> 00:06:52.933
No matter what,

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:55.869
it must've hurt you deeply, Soo Ah.

00:06:57.671 --> 00:06:59.406
I was too thoughtless. I'm sorry.

00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:02.209
But...

00:07:03.977 --> 00:07:05.346
your parents...

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:10.250
treated me like a son.

00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:15.022
I don't have feelings for you,
and I'm not seeing anyone.

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:18.225
I'll just say goodbye to your dad
and leave.

00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:21.729
And this.

00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:32.940
I realized these come in handy
at funerals.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.188
(Knee support)

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:52.159
(Lean on me
when you're exhausted and worn out.)

00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:58.565
He's annoying.

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:10.411
(Missed calls,
Director, Deputy Director)

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:13.514
- Soo Ah.
- Yeah?

00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:15.082
- Guests are here.
- Okay.

00:08:20.087 --> 00:08:20.888
Director.

00:08:22.489 --> 00:08:24.591
I'm sorry. I just saw my phone.

00:08:25.893 --> 00:08:27.528
Let me pay my respects first.

00:08:28.195 --> 00:08:29.063
Yes.

00:08:53.487 --> 00:08:55.422
His father was still so young.

00:08:55.422 --> 00:08:56.724
Then how...

00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.994
I heard he'd been hospitalized
for a long time.

00:08:59.994 --> 00:09:01.628
And she never showed it?

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.198
Ms. Choi is honestly...

00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:07.501
I didn't think it was right
to keep it to just bereavement leave.

00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.635
You did the right thing, sir.

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:10.337
We almost would've passed by
without knowing.

00:09:10.871 --> 00:09:11.839
Thank you.

00:09:12.573 --> 00:09:14.508
By the way, who are you?

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:17.544
Ms. Choi's older brother?

00:09:17.544 --> 00:09:18.412
No.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:20.247
Soo Ah said she's an only child.

00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:23.250
Well, I'm...

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.919
He's my cousin.

00:09:26.787 --> 00:09:28.756
We don't look alike at all, right?

00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:31.659
I didn't inherit much from my mom's side.

00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:34.828
See, I have thin hair,

00:09:34.828 --> 00:09:36.997
but he has so much.

00:09:36.997 --> 00:09:39.733
My mom and aunt both have very thick hair.

00:09:40.634 --> 00:09:42.403
How lucky.

00:09:46.874 --> 00:09:48.308
Ms. Choi, have you eaten anything?

00:09:48.308 --> 00:09:50.044
- Shall we eat together?
- Let's eat together.

00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:51.578
I'm okay.

00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:52.413
Hey, cousin.

00:09:53.347 --> 00:09:55.049
Eat something.

00:09:55.549 --> 00:09:56.483
I'll...

00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:59.019
bring it to you.

00:10:00.354 --> 00:10:01.388
You can all eat together.

00:10:01.755 --> 00:10:02.823
Please.

00:10:04.825 --> 00:10:06.627
You two cousins are close.

00:10:06.994 --> 00:10:07.861
How nice.

00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:28.182
Honey.

00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:30.818
What if someone hears you?

00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:37.958
Well,

00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:42.062
I was going to tell you,

00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:45.532
but everything was so overwhelming,

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:47.201
so I couldn't really...

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:51.205
It must've been so hard.

00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:54.608
Was your father unwell for a long time?

00:10:56.777 --> 00:10:58.245
About three years.

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:01.348
The pancreatic cancer came back
after surgery,

00:11:01.915 --> 00:11:03.417
so he stayed in the hospital.

00:11:05.953 --> 00:11:06.887
I see.

00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:12.192
I'm sorry.

00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:17.164
Don't apologize for that.
It just makes me sad.

00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:21.468
If it were me, I'd feel hurt.

00:11:25.072 --> 00:11:25.939
Honey.

00:11:26.507 --> 00:11:28.609
You're the one going through
the hardest time right now.

00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:29.677
I understand.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.016
But you...

00:11:36.016 --> 00:11:37.951
Yeah?

00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:39.219
You should...

00:11:39.753 --> 00:11:41.789
just think about yourself first, honey.

00:11:43.123 --> 00:11:46.226
Why are you crying?

00:11:47.194 --> 00:11:49.730
No, I'm sorry.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.634
I just thought
your heart must be breaking.

00:11:53.634 --> 00:11:55.536
When you said you couldn't see me
that weekend,

00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:57.371
it was because you were visiting
your father, right?

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:00.908
I didn't even know that and got upset.

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:02.710
And I complained
about not getting to see you.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.878
I must've seemed so childish.

00:12:04.878 --> 00:12:05.913
No.

00:12:05.913 --> 00:12:07.514
That's not true.

00:12:07.514 --> 00:12:09.116
It is.

00:12:09.116 --> 00:12:11.085
I'm sorry.

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.787
I should've been someone
you could lean on.

00:12:14.421 --> 00:12:17.424
I'll be more mature from now on.

00:12:19.493 --> 00:12:20.361
Thank you.

00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:22.429
No. Thank you.

00:12:24.198 --> 00:12:27.034
I promise I'll really become
a reliable boyfriend,

00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:29.536
like an older brother.

00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:32.039
Honey.

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:39.380
Actually,

00:12:40.047 --> 00:12:42.049
there's something I didn't tell you.

00:12:43.283 --> 00:12:46.253
Tell me. I'm really fine with everything.

00:12:50.257 --> 00:12:51.792
The man inside...

00:12:53.894 --> 00:12:55.029
is not my cousin.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.698
What?

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.301
He's my ex-boyfriend.

00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:04.138
The one I dated for ten years.

00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:14.815
Here you go.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.695
Jung Min.

00:13:28.395 --> 00:13:29.263
What is this?

00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:32.366
- Are you two getting back...
- No.

00:13:33.534 --> 00:13:34.802
No.

00:13:38.439 --> 00:13:39.873
Then why are you here?

00:13:39.873 --> 00:13:41.542
If you need anything else, just tell me.

00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:45.546
Jung Min, come here.

00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:46.480
Okay.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.816
I'm not really sure what to do with this.

00:13:48.816 --> 00:13:50.050
What is this?

00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:52.453
This...

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.756
What? Why is Han Jung Min here?

00:13:55.756 --> 00:13:58.892
Isn't he the guy you said
you're seeing these days?

00:13:58.892 --> 00:13:59.727
The junior from work.

00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:02.696
Well, yeah.

00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:04.498
I guess I mentioned him.

00:14:04.498 --> 00:14:08.435
What? So your ex
and your current boyfriend are both here?

00:14:10.037 --> 00:14:11.638
This is insane.

00:14:15.342 --> 00:14:16.577
How long have you been dating?

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.147
A hundred days.

00:14:23.317 --> 00:14:25.719
Hey, that's cute.

00:14:38.932 --> 00:14:40.701
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:53.447
Bye.

00:14:53.747 --> 00:14:55.149
Thanks for coming all this way.

00:14:56.283 --> 00:14:57.751
Get some rest now.

00:14:58.252 --> 00:15:00.888
You've been through a lot,
taking care of your father.

00:15:02.323 --> 00:15:03.290
I'll go now.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.967
(Funeral Hall)

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.042
- Sir.
- Yes?

00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:24.011
It's not you.

00:15:24.011 --> 00:15:27.047
Where's that decent young man?

00:15:27.047 --> 00:15:28.649
The one who said he'd carry the casket.

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:30.617
There he is. Excuse me.

00:15:30.617 --> 00:15:31.485
Yes?

00:15:33.087 --> 00:15:35.856
- About the casket transfer at dawn.
- Yes.

00:15:35.856 --> 00:15:38.726
You'll need to help
from the moment it leaves the hall.

00:15:38.726 --> 00:15:39.493
Yes.

00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:41.762
So be out front by 6:10 a.m.

00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:42.830
Understood.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.431
- Please write down your contact number.
- Yes.

00:15:47.334 --> 00:15:49.436
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:55.142
Excuse me.

00:15:57.778 --> 00:15:58.612
Me?

00:16:00.047 --> 00:16:01.949
Why are you carrying
Soo Ah's father's casket?

00:16:04.218 --> 00:16:05.052
Pardon?

00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:07.154
You're not her cousin,

00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:09.289
and you're not family.
This makes me uncomfortable.

00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:11.959
Uncomfortable?

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.194
You?

00:16:16.563 --> 00:16:18.866
Please step aside. I'll carry it.

00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:21.435
Excuse me.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.271
Did you know Soo Ah's father?

00:16:26.507 --> 00:16:29.977
He would want me to carry it.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.814
Did you ask him?

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:37.084
Every time we went night hiking,

00:16:37.084 --> 00:16:40.487
he said if anything happened, I should
take care of Soo Ah and her mother.

00:16:40.487 --> 00:16:42.289
I'm just keeping that promise.

00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:45.592
That was before he knew
you two had broken up.

00:16:45.826 --> 00:16:48.062
If he'd known, he wouldn't have said that.

00:16:48.062 --> 00:16:51.165
What kind of father
would favor someone who hurt his daughter?

00:16:52.032 --> 00:16:54.902
Is he too old to know
when to step in and when to step back?

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.706
When something hard happens, don't people
usually turn to their partner first?

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:01.775
What did you say?

00:17:03.944 --> 00:17:06.213
That's what Soo Ah used to do with me.

00:17:06.747 --> 00:17:08.449
Whenever things got hard,
she called me first and...

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:09.817
You insane bastard.

00:17:09.817 --> 00:17:10.851
What do you think you're doing right now?

00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:12.686
- There are lines you don't cross.
- Let go!

00:17:12.686 --> 00:17:14.221
What are you two doing?

00:17:14.788 --> 00:17:16.924
Honey, you decide.

00:17:17.591 --> 00:17:19.360
Is it right for him
to carry your father's casket?

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.394
I'll do it.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.432
Yes, Soo Ah. You decide.

00:17:25.766 --> 00:17:27.401
Who should carry your father's casket?

00:17:32.506 --> 00:17:34.308
Who's carrying my dad's casket?

00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:39.847
Why don't you just decide
by rock, paper, scissors?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.418
Both of you should go home.

00:17:46.053 --> 00:17:47.187
Honey.

00:17:47.187 --> 00:17:48.522
Didn't you hear me?

00:17:49.256 --> 00:17:51.392
I said both of you should just go home.

00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:06.273
What's wrong with this?

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:09.877
No.

00:18:14.782 --> 00:18:16.250
Damn it.

00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:55.923
I'll stay upstairs.

00:19:14.008 --> 00:19:15.042
Do you know...

00:19:18.779 --> 00:19:21.015
what my dad looked like at the end?

00:19:24.084 --> 00:19:26.053
He was down to skin and bones
and looked like a mummy.

00:19:32.026 --> 00:19:34.128
I hated seeing him like that.

00:19:37.598 --> 00:19:38.999
At the nursing hospital,

00:19:40.234 --> 00:19:42.136
the elderly cry out...

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.572
because they're in pain,
and they're suffering.

00:19:56.517 --> 00:19:57.685
Are you in pain?

00:19:58.018 --> 00:19:59.386
I'll give you an antibiotic.

00:20:02.122 --> 00:20:03.757
That voice echoing down the hallway...

00:20:05.326 --> 00:20:06.860
was my dad's.

00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:12.232
But in front of me,
he never showed it once.

00:20:18.772 --> 00:20:21.108
I even thought it might be better
if he passed away.

00:20:23.944 --> 00:20:25.512
Maybe that's why he left so quickly.

00:20:27.214 --> 00:20:28.849
So I wouldn't suffer anymore.

00:20:33.187 --> 00:20:34.955
Even if it hurt me,

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:40.627
I wish he'd stayed a little longer.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.468
I'm sorry.

00:20:50.104 --> 00:20:51.572
You must have been in so much pain.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.585
Give it to me.

00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:06.320
I can do it.

00:21:06.754 --> 00:21:08.122
Give it to me. I'll do it.

00:21:08.122 --> 00:21:10.124
- No, I will.
- Give it to me.

00:21:18.632 --> 00:21:20.367
I'll go get something to wipe with.

00:21:21.201 --> 00:21:22.202
Why did you do that?

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.243
I was really struggling.
Why did you do that?

00:21:31.845 --> 00:21:33.414
They were looking for you
at the hospital too.

00:21:33.647 --> 00:21:35.416
My dad really cared about you.

00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:37.317
So I couldn't even say a bad word
about you.

00:21:37.317 --> 00:21:39.420
Do you know how hard that was for me?

00:21:52.199 --> 00:21:53.367
Just go.

00:21:57.137 --> 00:21:58.272
I don't want to see your face.

00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:07.514
I wanted to know
how hard it was for you too.

00:22:09.516 --> 00:22:11.318
When your father was diagnosed
with cancer,

00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:13.220
you were with me.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.225
You took the call
and stayed in the bathroom forever.

00:22:18.225 --> 00:22:20.327
I knew something was wrong.

00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:23.263
Your eyes were all red,

00:22:23.964 --> 00:22:26.100
but no matter how much I asked,
you said it was nothing.

00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:29.103
I wanted to know.

00:22:32.373 --> 00:22:33.774
I wanted to listen.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.545
I wanted to hold you too, Soo Ah.

00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:01.335
You came.

00:23:11.879 --> 00:23:14.114
I hate all this talk
about who carries the casket.

00:23:16.917 --> 00:23:17.951
I just...

00:23:21.522 --> 00:23:23.457
wish my dad were still alive.

00:23:27.261 --> 00:23:28.362
My dad's casket.

00:23:30.898 --> 00:23:32.800
I wish no one would carry it.

00:23:38.572 --> 00:23:39.840
I want to be alone.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.484
Excuse me.

00:23:57.691 --> 00:23:58.759
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:01.628
My father passed away when I was young.

00:24:02.663 --> 00:24:04.365
Soo Ah's father really looked after me,

00:24:05.265 --> 00:24:06.567
almost like he was my own dad.

00:24:07.768 --> 00:24:09.670
That stayed with me.

00:24:10.471 --> 00:24:13.574
I came just to say thank you. That's all.

00:24:14.842 --> 00:24:15.943
But it turned out like this.

00:24:18.612 --> 00:24:21.849
Soo Ah's father was a really good man,
wasn't he?

00:24:23.917 --> 00:24:24.818
Yes.

00:24:25.352 --> 00:24:26.587
I thought so.

00:24:27.388 --> 00:24:30.457
Who would come all this way
to an ex-girlfriend's father's funeral?

00:24:33.727 --> 00:24:35.295
May I ask your name?

00:24:37.498 --> 00:24:38.399
Kang In Ho.

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:39.733
Kang In Ho.

00:24:40.467 --> 00:24:43.604
Then he probably would've called you
"My son, Ho."

00:24:44.204 --> 00:24:45.272
"My son, Ho?"

00:24:46.607 --> 00:24:48.108
He used to say that someday,
when Soo Ah got married,

00:24:48.108 --> 00:24:50.844
his dream was to go
to the bathhouse with his son-in-law.

00:24:51.578 --> 00:24:52.980
Like a father and son.

00:24:56.316 --> 00:24:58.519
That's a shame.
I'm really good at scrubbing backs.

00:25:01.288 --> 00:25:02.156
I see.

00:25:05.659 --> 00:25:06.727
You can go.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:10.664
Excuse me.

00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:14.435
You said sorry earlier, right?

00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:35.055
Well, I feel way better now.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.959
You didn't come here
because you still had feelings, did you?

00:25:41.862 --> 00:25:43.097
Hey, what are you doing?

00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:46.700
You're the guys from Room 5, right?

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.534
Yes.

00:25:47.534 --> 00:25:49.136
Hey, you can't throw trash there.

00:25:49.136 --> 00:25:51.805
No, that's not trash, it's...

00:25:51.805 --> 00:25:52.906
Pick it up right now.

00:25:53.907 --> 00:25:54.708
Yes, sir.

00:25:55.809 --> 00:25:56.877
But...

00:25:57.978 --> 00:25:59.980
are you two going home?

00:26:01.648 --> 00:26:03.684
Leaving the lady from Room 5 all alone?

00:26:03.684 --> 00:26:05.786
Well, she said she wanted to be alone.

00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:06.820
Goodness.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.823
At times like this,
you just stay by their side.

00:26:09.823 --> 00:26:12.926
You'd know
if you'd ever been through a funeral.

00:26:18.232 --> 00:26:20.434
(The late Choi Myeong Gil)

00:26:20.434 --> 00:26:25.239
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

00:26:27.207 --> 00:26:28.308
Dad.

00:26:32.846 --> 00:26:33.814
Honey.

00:26:38.652 --> 00:26:39.620
Mom.

00:26:42.056 --> 00:26:42.890
Yeah?

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.094
Soo Ah.

00:26:48.696 --> 00:26:49.530
Yeah.

00:26:55.836 --> 00:26:56.870
But...

00:26:58.105 --> 00:26:59.973
who's carrying his casket?

00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:02.242
Just pay for it.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:04.978
That's the easiest on the heart.

00:27:28.635 --> 00:27:29.703
Yeon Ju.

00:27:30.604 --> 00:27:31.505
What do we do?

00:27:33.907 --> 00:27:35.142
Hey.

00:27:40.247 --> 00:27:41.348
Lie down, Mom.

00:28:20.921 --> 00:28:22.356
Thank you for coming.

00:28:22.356 --> 00:28:23.290
You must be exhausted.

00:28:40.341 --> 00:28:41.608
You need to eat to keep your strength up.

00:29:30.424 --> 00:29:33.360
Hold the casket by sliding your hands in
from top to bottom,

00:29:33.861 --> 00:29:36.430
with the backs of your hands
facing the casket.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.197
Yes.

00:29:37.197 --> 00:29:40.601
And when you head out,
watch the steps and thresholds.

00:30:13.334 --> 00:30:14.234
Carry it.

00:30:28.449 --> 00:30:29.350
Carry it.

00:30:36.423 --> 00:30:39.426
(Funeral Hall)

00:31:11.892 --> 00:31:14.328
As if only now she could finally feel...

00:31:16.664 --> 00:31:18.265
that this was her father's funeral,

00:31:21.869 --> 00:31:22.970
the rain poured down,

00:31:25.005 --> 00:31:26.740
heavy and cleansing.

00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:33.881
Hearts willing to carry
someone else's burden,

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.886
asking for nothing in return,
quietly shimmered.

00:31:42.956 --> 00:31:43.991
As if only now...

00:31:45.292 --> 00:31:47.161
she could finally feel...

00:31:49.997 --> 00:31:51.699
that this was her father's funeral,

00:31:54.902 --> 00:31:56.003
the rain poured down,

00:31:59.473 --> 00:32:02.743
heavy and cleansing.

00:32:07.081 --> 00:32:07.948
Dad.

00:32:10.351 --> 00:32:11.318
See you again.

00:32:30.324 --> 00:32:32.324
