00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:28.040
This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.760
I told you, this time wouldn’t be like before.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.920
Shit, my money's gone, damn it!

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920
Weren’t you betting at Mr. Thep’s table?

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.280
No need to stress, Mr. Thep’s easygoing.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.080
Anyway, thank you darling

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.240
for paying it all off.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.920
From now on, you’re debt-free.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.680
Do you still want to stay at the Academy?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.240
So…

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.400
do you want a boxer as your boyfriend?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.760
Are you okay?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320
Okay.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.080
Let’s keep packing.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.280
I almost forgot.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520
Just a sec.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.800
Feeling refreshed?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.040
Thanks.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.680
Hero VS Hero

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.760
I’ve packed everything on this side.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.360
Where else do you want me to pack?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400
What book is that, Keen?

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.880
It’s a crossword puzzle book.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.200
My dad liked me to play with this to sharpen my mind.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.640
(What’s dad even doing?)

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.920
(An English entrance exam?)

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.600
Whoa.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.920
Mom, you're pretty smart too, huh?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.080
Of course!

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.960
Oh hey, Dad’s here right on time.
What are you guys up to?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.520
Solving the crossword puzzle I made?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.120
Let me see how it’s going.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.840
Dad, this puzzle is too hard.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.360
Why?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.320
I'm just a kid, I can’t solve it.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.600
There’s no riddle that can’t be solved.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.520
Sometimes, the answer is easier than we think,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.680
If we open our hears.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.080
Let me see.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.640
Both heroes and villains know its weight,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.280
Giving up for others seals their fate.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.480
Sacrifice!

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.840
Whoa, impressive.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.600
Well, you’ve been to my house before.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.040
I’m not dumb, you know.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.640
Hey!

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.200
You’re so smug.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.880
Alright, alright, I’ll stop talking.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.880
Let’s just keep packing.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.680
Keen.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.720
Let’s go.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.960
Hey, should we change how we call each other?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.160
You want to change it?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.360
Well, we’ve changed our relationship status…

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360
We should change how we address each other too.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.160
Calling each other "you" forever feels weird.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.920
So what should we call each other then?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.000
Me and my bro?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What do you think?

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.880
Are you serious?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.360
How about Pookie and Bubba?

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.400
That’s too sweet.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.320
Darling?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.840
Ugh, there’s no use for all those words.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.080
Okay, how about we just use our names?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
Thun.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.720
Keen?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.320
Yes.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.400
Thun.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.120
Let’s take a photo.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.600
Smile.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.200
One, two, three.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600
One, two, three.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.280
Hey,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.880
seriously?, Thun.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.000
One more, one more.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.360
One, two, three.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.520
Let’s go.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.080
Wait.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.360
I don’t want to get out yet.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.120
I’m going to miss this quiet time with just us.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.440
Aren’t you going to unload your stuff?

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.440
Come on, we’ve got this peaceful moment together right now.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.800
You’re going to let it pass?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.880
Once we start...

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.720
There’s no turning back.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.920
Aaaaah!

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.560
What’s up, Mawin?

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.520
Didn’t you say you’d pay back Sia Thep with your boxing money?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.560
Huh? Trying to run from me?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.560
Where’s my fucking money?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.600
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.720
Recording us?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.200
Huh?!

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.360
Hey, stay back.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.440
Why, old man?

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.520
Out of respect for your age.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.280
Didn’t you say Sia Thep was kind?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.720
You said I didn’t have to pay right away?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.760
I’ll talk to Sia Thep myself.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.040
You guys are just his lackeys.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.040
Hey!
Don’t!

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.720
Shut up!
Hey!

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.720
Don’t butt in!

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.560
You son of a!

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.080
Hey!

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.840
You want to stick your nose in?!

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.200
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.800
Hey!

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800
No role in this? Then stay out!

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.640
I don’t know what my son did,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.600
But can we have a bit more time?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.920
I’m not running.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.000
We’ll pay it back.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.720
Like your son said, Sia Thep’s kind.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.040
He gave you a week.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.480
Find 500,000 baht and pay Sia Thep back.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.720
What? Just one week?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.720
Can we have a month?

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.920
I’ll pay you back.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.040
Ugh... what do you think, Dang?

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.080
Sure.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.840
Fine, a month.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.520
But I want a million back in interest.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.080
What? A million?!

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.720
Hey!

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.520
Come on! That’s way too much!

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.640
Might as well kill me now!

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.840
You said it yourself, asshole.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.960
Enough already!

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.480
I can fulfill that death wish if you want!

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.840
Okay, okay.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.720
We’ll find a way to pay it back.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.760
Just don’t hurt the kids.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.080
Dad.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.200
If you don’t pay in a month!

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.520
You know what’ll happen.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.160
Let’s go, Dang.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.560
Are you insane?!

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.760
You gambled away hundreds of thousands?!

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.520
Back when it was just small bets, I never said anything.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.680
But how could you lose 400-500K like that?!

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.360
I thought I’d use my trading profits to pay it back, Dad.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.280
But who would’ve thought Thun would lose?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.760
I mean, who would've thought they'd cheat like that?!

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.040
Uncle Petch, looks like almost all the students are canceling our courses.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.760
They’re asking for refunds too.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.720
We’ll halt the courses for now.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.680
We’ll reopen when things improve.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.040
And the course fees?

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.920
We’ll have to refund the remaining amount.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.400
Call the students and tell them to come collect their refunds.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.040
Got it.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.920
(Petchsak Academy)

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.120
Dad.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.360
You made that promise with them.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.280
Do you have a way to get the money?

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.160
Are you crazy?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.600
You caused this mess, you fix it yourself.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.080
What I said was just to protect my students.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.120
But if I can’t get the money...

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.960
Sia Thep will kill me for sure.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.600
What about the gym’s savings?

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.960
Can’t we use that first?

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.120
You still have that pickup truck, don’t you?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.680
Sell it and use the money to pay off the debt.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.280
But the truck’s necessary, Dad.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.800
Thun has a car.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.000
Borrow his for now.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.720
But that’s my car!

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.600
Hey!

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.200
You decide.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.760
Figure out how to pay the debt.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.320
Grow up already.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.720
Dad.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.880
Shit!

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.440
What the hell is this?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.920
Who did you transfer the money to?

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.000
Didn’t you say that money belonged to all of us?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.520
What did you do with it?

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
You have secrets from us now?!

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.320
Huh?!

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.200
What are you even talking about?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.200
And who told you to snoop through my phone?!

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.360
Then who did you send the money to?!

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.960
Answer me, Dad!

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.480
Do you have secrets from us?!

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.200
Answer me, Dad!

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.120
Dad!

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.880
Because of the way you are!

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.800
I’m an officer from the DSI.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.520
Your son is involved in serious money laundering.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.960
I’ve traced the related transactions.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.200
I’m required to proceed with legal action.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:57.000
If you and your son really didn’t do anything wrong, then just transfer the money to ONCB to have it checked for transparency.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.200
Yeah, yeah… that’s just how my son is.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.200
He didn’t mean to.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.920
Let me handle this.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.160
He’s still my son, too.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.320
Here’s what we’ll do:

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.880
I’ll take responsibility and manage everything this time.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.480
Just transfer the money into the account, and I’ll take care of the paperwork.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.560
Alright, alright.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.680
Hang on a second.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.880
By the time I realized I’d been scammed, the money was already gone.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.360
Are you crazy? You told me to sell my car because of this?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360
That means all our money is gone.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.600
This is exactly why I…

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.200
Money laundering!

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.360
Money laundering!

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.320
You never believed me, did you?

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.120
That I could actually make money from trading.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.440
That’s why you believed those fucking bastards instead!

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.760
That I was laundering money!

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.400
What’s wrong with you, Dad?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.120
How could you be so stupid to fall for a damn call center scam?

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.640
If it wasn’t for you,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.520
we’d be paying back Sia Thep in no time.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.720
Yeah, I’m an idiot.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.240
An idiot just because it’s you.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.480
Hey, calm down.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.840
Uncle Petch believed them because he was worried about you.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.200
You're an outsider! Fuck off!

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.240
Yeah!

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.720
Right. I’m an outsider.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.440
Why did you say such things like that to him?

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.440
What do you even know?

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.720
People have died because of scams like this.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.280
or does it have to be his turn before you realize?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Uncle Petch.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.160
Are you okay, Keen?

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320
It’s the irony, huh?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.120
These scam calls just keep coming after me like a nightmare.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:48.480
Back then, my mom got scammed and nearly lost everything.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.800
She was so stressed

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.160
that she had a stroke.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.240
My dad had to sell the house just to try to save her.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.680
But in the end…

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.800
we couldn’t save her.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.120
I get where Mawin is coming from.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.800
As a child who’s been fooled by their parents.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.520
But I’m also with Uncle Petch.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.720
When it’s about someone you love,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.080
we are all just idiots.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.160
Having to go through this all over again

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.520
makes me feel like I can't control myself.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.520
Ait.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.920
I get how you feel.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.040
But you're not carrying this alone.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.800
Uncle Petch wanted to help.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.800
Keen wanted to help.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.920
And if there’s anything I can do, I want to help too.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.840
But you can’t take all this on by yourself.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.200
Still, after everything I said,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.200
who’d still want to help me?

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.880
If you know you messed up, then go fix it.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.160
You already know what you need to do, don’t you?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.440
Right here?!

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.680
What are you doing?

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.080
Looking for a list of promoters.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.760
Gonna ask them to get our fighters in the ring.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.960
This one’s better, try calling the numbers in here.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.080
Tell them I sent you.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.960
How are you gonna get there? Want a ride?

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.320
Nah, I’ll have Thun take me.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.880
I’ll go with you.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.120
Come on, at least I’ve got more experience.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.640
Better than sending you and Thun off on your own.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.920
And… I’m sorry

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.040
for calling you an outsider the other day.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.080
Honestly, it’s good you’re still butting in.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.440
Man… getting Thun Tiger Taming Canon into a match like this…

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.200
Who’d dare match up with him?

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.280
Huh?

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.800
Even last time, despite the shady booking,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.240
he still tore Typhoon apart.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.920
No way.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.400
If your guys really want to fight,

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.040
I’ll need a 30% cut as a commission.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.680
I’ll find you a match right away.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.040
That’s straight-up exploitation!

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.480
It’s interesting, but I’ll pass for now.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.880
Unless you can find a sponsor.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.680
They’re back!

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.600
Right?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.760
Keen, Thun, come eat!

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.440
That look says it all.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.720
No luck, huh?

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.600
Come eat first, guys.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.960
Oh, don’t make that face.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.920
Eat up so you’ve got strength.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.600
Come on, Keen, sit here.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.880
You too, Thun.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.280
Pass me a plate, please.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.640
How did it go with the promoters, bro?

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.320
I’m okay with fighting in smaller events, honestly.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.040
Even if they lowball me.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.600
At least we’ll get some cash coming in.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.680
Man, if I had the money,

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.040
I’d just organize a fight night myself.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.680
And I’d put all our fighters

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.680
in the ring.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.680
Wouldn’t that be awesome?

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.000
You’re dreaming.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.920
Wait, actually…

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.520
Why don’t we just organize it ourselves?

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.600
Are you crazy? Organizing a boxing event isn’t easy.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.080
First of all, you need money.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.920
And right now, the gym’s already in debt.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.920
Right, Thun?

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.880
Yeah.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.080
Bung’s right. To host a fight, you need connections.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.640
And you’ll need at least 5–6 million baht.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.640
Do you have that kind of cash?

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.840
I’ve got 200 baht, bro.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.280
See? No one’s got the money.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.600
Or are you gonna take out more loans

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.080
and sink the gym deeper into debt?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Exactly. And even if we do it, there’s no guarantee it’ll make a profit.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.280
If we lose money, that’d be even worse.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.840
At first, I thought it sounded like a solid idea.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.080
But after hearing all this,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.080
it makes sense.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.080
Come on, eat. Let’s just eat.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.600
No more talk.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.920
This one’s good, try this.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.240
I like this one.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.720
I saved it just for today.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.400
Now you feel bad, huh?

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.640
I was saving that.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.120
Hey, what’s wrong with you today?

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.640
You’re not eating?

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.160
I bought this just for you, bro.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.320
I was worried you might have trouble chewing it.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.480
Hurry or the food will be gone, bro.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.480
Thun.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.920
Why is everyone so against me?

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.400
Even though I'm just trying to fix things.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.000
Because what you're trying to do is really difficult.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.800
It’s something everyone in the industry knows.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.720
So we’re just going to let it stay this way?

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.800
No one’s going to try to fix it?

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.520
Well, it is the truth.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.720
But Thun, you're known on social media.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.120
Your voice matters and can help fix this.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.320
Keen

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.320
Where are you going?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.200
I’m hungry.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.480
Going to get something to eat.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.960
I’ll come with you.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.360
Don’t follow me.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.160
Hey, what are you doing sitting here alone?

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.520
Wanna have a drink with me?

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.360
I’m fine, I just want to be alone.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.360
Come on, don’t be like that.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.360
Don’t play hard to get.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.240
Let go.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.200
Come on now.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:28.920
Come, come.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.440
Let go!

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.720
Ow!

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.280
What the hell’s your problem?

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.960
You punched me?

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.560
You little!

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.600
I think you’ve had too much to drink.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800
Who the hell asked you to butt in?

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.120
Ow!

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.320
You should go back to your friends.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.520
Let’s not make this a bigger deal.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.480
You.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.000
I’ll remember this, you hear me?

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.480
Thank you so much.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.640
Yeah.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.440
One whiskey on the rocks, please.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.800
Sure.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
My name’s Yut.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.520
Okay.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.920
Why are you sitting here doing crosswords alone?

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.920
Mind if I take a look?

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:05.720
I just wanted somewhere to sit and do a crossword peacefully, that’s all.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.120
You were pretty cool back there.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.880
Are you a fighter or something?

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.120
I used to be a Muay Thai boxer.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.280
I can tell when someone’s trained.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.720
Can we not talk about Muay Thai for a bit?

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.720
I’m honestly sick of it.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.160
Then what should we talk about?

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.960
Anything that’s not Muay Thai.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.040
Alright… do you have a boyfriend?

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.320
A boyfriend?

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.720
He does.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.880
Keen, let’s go.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.840
Keen, huh?

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.520
Keen, let’s talk outside.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.320
Let’s go clear things up first.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.800
What are you doing, Keen?

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.560
That’s enough, Keen.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.680
Is this what you want?

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.080
Didn’t you say you were hungry?

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.760
I am eating.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040
Nice weather, huh?

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.320
How do you know this place, Ait?

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.040
After work, I usually come eat around here.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.880
Scouting for date spots or what?

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.720
Does your wound still hurt?

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.760
A little,

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.760
but it’s okay.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.000
And about the debt, what are you going to do?

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760
You know, Ait…

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:29.440
I know I messed up and need to find a way to pay it off.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.080
But this pickup truck…

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.600
It’s my pride and joy.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:01.480
Still, it’s money you earned yourself.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.280
If you used it to fix the problem you caused,

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.120
I think it’d be way cooler.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.880
You’re probably the only one who cares about me like this, Ait.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.600
Ow!

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.080
Sorry.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.440
I didn’t mean to.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.440
It’s okay.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.160
Right here?

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.480
You don’t like it?

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.400
I do.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.040
Hold on a sec.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.840
I really have to take this call.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.720
I’ll be right back.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.440
I’m sorry I ran off to the bar.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.280
It’s okay.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.600
I probably made you feel uncomfortable, didn’t I?

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.520
I really want to help the gym.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.800
But I know no one listens to me.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.160
You, though—people believe you when you speak.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.080
Why won’t you speak up for me?

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:14.680
I’m sorry, Keen, for making you feel that way.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:42.400
From now on, I’ll trust and support you.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.320
Thanks, Thun.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.560
Feeling better now?

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.920
Then…

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.920
How about we go for round three?

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.520
So, what’s our plan?

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.400
I still believe we should go with organizing our own tournament.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.640
I know it’s hard, but it’s our only shot at saving the gym.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:08.640
I’ll need everyone’s cooperation.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.880
You’re still going on about that?

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.200
We already talked about this.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.280
But I agree with Keen.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.920
We’ve got to try something.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.920
It’s better than doing nothing.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.800
If you need anything, just let me know.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.800
I’ve got your back.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.920
I just want everyone to look for possibilities, not just problems.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.880
If we can really make the tournament happen,

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.440
it could be a great chance

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.800
to restore the gym’s reputation.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.440
But where are we gonna get the money?

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.680
It’s going to be a lot of money.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.840
Maybe we can go find some sponsors to support part of it first.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.200
Keen

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.680
Keen, do you know MP Phuwish?

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.520
MP Phuwish?

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.120
The name sounds familiar,

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.200
but I can’t quite place it.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:29.480
He’s a politician known for promoting Muay Thai.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.760
Maybe you could reach out and ask him to support us.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.960
But what if we still can’t raise the money?

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.440
What are we going to do then?

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.440
Won’t it all be a waste of time?

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.600
I think we need a backup plan.

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.400
It’s alright.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.080
I still have some valuable amulets.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.280
I’ll go sell them.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.240
Those alone won’t be enough to cover everything.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.160
I’ll sell my truck too.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.840
Once everything’s settled, I can buy a new one when I have the money.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.680
Let’s not jump too far ahead, everyone.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.240
I’ll hurry back and put together a proposal for MP Phuwish.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.440
As for selling our stuff, let’s take a breath before making that call.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.680
Sure.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.120
The answer we’re looking for might be easier than we think…

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.400
If we just open our heart.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:11.240
The answer we’re looking for might be easier than we think if we open our heart.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.200
(Ait, come here.)

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.440
Ait.
Where are you going, Mai?

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.520
Come play with us.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.600
Let’s shoot a video.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.840
Have you seen superhero fights before?

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:39.360
Huh?

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.720
Like superheroes fighting each other.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.360
You can be the hero and fight me.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.360
How do we fight?

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:49.040
Earth, water, wind, fire.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:49.840
Uhh…

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.440
Hey, Ait, take it seriously!

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.560
Do I have to get hurt for real?

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.400
Just pretend you’re a superhero.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.680
Be whoever you want.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.360
I’ll use earth, water, wind, and fire.

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.040
Ow! Like this?

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.560
(Hot, hot!)

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.120
(Come on, come at me!)
How’s it going, Keen?

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.640
(Not yet!)

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.480
(Not yet?)
Just a sec.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.400
Oh right, the sword too!

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.120
Let’s go!

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.560
(Hey!)

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.280
I’ve got an idea.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:22.800
(Is he dead yet?)

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.280
(Not yet!)

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.440
(Come again, bro!)

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.800
(Yeah, yeah!)

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.960
(Thai’s Prestige Party)

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.520
Who are you here to see?

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.360
I’m here to see MP Phuwish.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.880
Do you have an appointment?

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.440
I tried to, but he seems to always be busy.

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.880
Can I please have just ten minutes with him?

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.880
If you don’t have a confirmed appointment, I can’t let you in.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.800
He’s extremely busy right now.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.000
Who is it?

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.840
Hello, sir.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.480
These two would like to see you.

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.880
Sure.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.720
Oh, Tiger Taming Cannon himself.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.960
So that is our gym’s current situation.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.600
Sounds like you’re really struggling.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.080
What do you want me to help with?

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.280
Sir, I’d like to ask for your financial support to hold a fight event for our gym.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.880
Please don’t use honorifics.

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.720
We're the same.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:18.000
Just call me Mr.

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.280
Alright, Mr.Phuwish.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.840
Like I said,

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.720
Petchsak Academy is a long-standing and respected gym.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:34.280
I believe if we host this event, it’ll really bring some energy back to Muay Thai.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.920
You’re planning to be a promoter yourself?

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:43.200
There are fewer than ten in the whole country.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.280
Even if Thun’s backing you,

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:49.160
it won’t be easy.

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.600
If this were a regular match,

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.520
I wouldn’t bother being the promoter.

00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:00.200
But the event I’m proposing isn’t traditional.

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.120
I’m turning it into sports entertainment to attract a new audience.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.160
The concept is Hero vs Villain as the main theme.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:23.320
Please take a look at the details in the proposal.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.360
Interesting.

00:59:54.120 --> 01:00:02.360
I’ll agree to sponsor you.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.840
Out of respect for your effort.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.840
But...

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.800
I want one specific fighter to return to the ring.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:33.480
If you can bring him back to fight,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.320
I’ll fully support your event.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.720
Are you serious?

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.440
You’re really going to come see him here,?

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.720
Of course.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.760
We’re already here in front of the foundation.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.240
We have to do this for the gym.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.200
We agreed, didn’t we?

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.280
Yeah.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.440
I’m…

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.040
I’m really sorry.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.440
I’ve quit fighting.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.120
I promised myself

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.920
I wouldn’t use my strength to hurt anyone again.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.800
But I really want you to come back and fight, Yut.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.280
Right now, I just want to dedicate

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.840
my life to the foundation.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.360
I want to help the kids.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.000
But if you fight,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.080
You’ll get financial support from MP Phuwish.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.240
That money could help a lot of kids.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.760
I think it’s a win-win for both of us.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.200
I misjudged you, Keen.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.160
At first, I thought you were just cute but turns out you’re smart too.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.720
Well, now it’s starting to sound interesting.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.040
The kids would be happy to get that support.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.720
Yes.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.000
In your eyes, I must be the hero, right Keen?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.800
But in that case… who’s going to be my villain?

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.160
Tiger Taming Cannon?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.920
Sounds like a great villain for me.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.600
I’m really looking forward to it.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.720
Uh.. How about we tweak the title a bit?

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.280
Instead of Hero vs Villain, let’s make it Hero vs Hero.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.200
That way, no one has to be the villain,

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.440
And both of us can feel comfortable.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.520
Sure.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.000
But before I agree,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.280
There’s somewhere I’d like to take you first.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.720
Come! Let's go home!

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.720
Wait a second.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.440
You don’t have to do it anymore.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.520
Hey.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.440
Sit down.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.800
Let's go back.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.000
So where do you want me to go, Yut?

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.120
Yay!

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.400
Do you all want to draw? Is everyone ready to draw today?

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.560
Ready!

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.440
You’ve got to be louder than that if you’re ready.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.320
Ready!

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.400
Very good! Let’s go, let’s draw.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.720
I’ll open the paint for you.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.280
This one here.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.880
Whose is this?

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.920
Whoever grabs it first gets it.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.360
Alright, keep drawing, I’ll be back.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.680
Santa will come down on Christmas Day.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.080
How are you doing, Keen?

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.120
Oh?
Having fun?

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.560
Lots of fun, the kids are all super sweet.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.560
I usually come here every week.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.760
To visit the kids, since they get lonely.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.360
I try to come and do activities with them.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.920
That’s great.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.120
The kids are very sweet.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.440
If you like them, I’m happy.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.360
Keaw, is Yut nice?

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.200
Is he nice?

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.440
He’s kind of nice.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.000
Oops.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.080
No ice cream for you then.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.480
He’s nice!

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.960
See, you said it fast now.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.640
Was it fun playing with P’Keen?

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.360
Yes! I want him to come again.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.960
Oh! You want Keen to come again?

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
Then we’ll have to ask him.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960
Keen, would you like to come back again?

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.240
Only if Yut invites me.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.720
Then I'll come.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.640
Wow, you even know how to draw shadows now.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.560
Hey.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.480
Is my drawing pretty?

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.720
Hey!

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.760
Um... it’s pretty.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.000
Can you pay more attention to our group?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.160
Look at the others.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.520
Color it in, just drawing like that won’t look nice.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.200
Has everyone finished their dream house drawing?

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.200
Finished!

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:49.920
Show us, let’s see!

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.400
Show it to us.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.600
Show it to me.
Quick, quick!

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.000
Wow, that’s a huge house. There’s a car too?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.320
There’s a bicycle as well!

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.760
Whoa, that one’s in the middle of the mountains.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.440
Everyone, give yourselves a round of applause!

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.240
Well done!

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.280
Everyone, did you know I have a special surprise for you today?

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.400
Sound good?

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.480
Whoa!

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.400
Excited?

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.600
Excited!

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.360
Today’s surprise is…

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.600
Someone will sing a song for all of us.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.520
Hoo!

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.800
That someone is… Keen!

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.400
Yay!

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.720
Do you all want to hear Keen sing?

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.760
Do you?

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.880
Yes!

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.360
Cheer for him!

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:39.040
Keen!

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.680
Will I survive this…
Please help me out.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.000
The kids really want to see you.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.320
Alright.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.800
Okay, everyone clap!

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.240
Let’s clap!

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.560
Well done!

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:18.360
♫ Every time I see you, you’re still the same one ♫

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:24.400
♫ Always messing with my heart, making it a mess every day ♫

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.320
♫ Can I be the one to stay ♫

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:39.600
♫ With you every day and night, with only me, is that okay ♫

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.680
♫ Let every night be filled with me in your dreams ♫

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.720
♫ The only one I see in mine is you ♫

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.880
♫ Come say hi, let’s see each other every day ♫

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:59.080
♫ Wouldn’t it be nice? What do you say? Will be a good night ♫

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.040
How was it?

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.640
It's was so good.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.880
Was that cute, everyone? Was it good?

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.800
Was it okay?
So cute!

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.160
Keen, are you and Yut dating?

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.280
No way, Keen doesn’t even have a boyfriend!

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.160
But you two are way too cute.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.840
You must be dating.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.600
If Keen’s going to date someone, it should be Thun!

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.920
Thun has a much better personality.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:33.160
But Keen and Yut look like a couple.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.800
Uh…

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.440
Do we really look like a couple?

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.320
You do.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.160
You don’t!

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.080
You do.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.080
You don’t!

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:40.560
You do.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.400
You don’t!

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.680
I said you do.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.000
I said we don’t!

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.200
To clear it up, Yut and I aren’t dating.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.800
See? Told you!

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.400
That is my boyfriend.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:00.120
Oh!

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.480
So you’ve agreed to fight now?

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.280
Yes.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.520
I’m going to fight.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.400
I’ve got a purpose now.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400
Hmm.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.920
Excellent.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.440
Great then.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.080
Don’t worry about the money.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.320
I’ll take care of it.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.920
Thank you.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.360
This amulet looks pretty good.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:34.840
Yeah.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.200
But…

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.280
Alright, as a friend

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.040
I can’t go over 500,000 baht.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.920
If it’s more than that, I can’t do it.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.560
Only 500,000, sir?

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.920
Yeah.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.280
That’s my max.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.600
The car’s in good condition, though.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.320
How about 480,000?

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.640
480,000?

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.560
Yeah, that’s about the market price.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.160
Please, 480,000—just help me out.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.200
Sell it to me since I came all the way here.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.600
Everyone!

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.560
Uncle Petch!

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.560
Uncle Petch!

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.800
P’Keen just called! He got a sponsor!

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.080
What? For real?

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.400
Yes, Uncle Petch.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.080
In that case, forget it.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.280
I won’t sell it just yet.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.360
Maybe next time.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.760
Come on, let me have the amulet back.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760
600,000 then.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.400
Never mind.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.680
P’Mawin, P’Keen just called!

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.440
He got a sponsor!

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.760
Then it’s okay, maybe next time.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.840
I won’t sell today.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.280
You can go now.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.880
You sure? No changing your mind?

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.520
It’s fine.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.920
I’m not selling.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.120
Go ahead.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.120
Go on.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.840
Bye-bye!

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.520
Yes!

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.280
My beloved baby!

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.960
My dearest one..

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.800
Back at the hospital.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.800
If I hadn’t been there,

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.920
What would you have done?

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.800
Are you jealous?

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.360
Thun, are you jealous of Keen?

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.160
What are you even doing?

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.760
I'm not Keen!

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.560
If you're jealous, then just tell me

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.840
what do you want me to do so you'll stop being mad?

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.160
What do you want?

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.760
I want to do it like that night.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.400
If we do it like that night, will you stop being mad?

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.360
Then tonight, see you.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.320
Hold on, bro. I really have to take this call.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.040
(Tell that Keen guy to go ask MP Phuwish for money.)

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.000
(He’ll definitely give it.)

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.080
Why does it have to be MP Phuwish, boss?

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.720
(MP Phuwish, I'm going to make him sink.)

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.720
Alright.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.760
I’ll be watching.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.960
Keen, you're amazing.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.800
I didn’t expect this to really happen.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.720
From now on, I won’t be fighting for myself or for Keen anymore.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.080
Thun will be doing it for us.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.880
I will always be by your side.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.360
Let’s head to your room.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.040
Isn’t Mai in the room?

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.480
Then let’s go to the office.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.400
What should we do, Keen?

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.800
A thousand seats, and less than two weeks—can we sell them all?

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.960
My fans are mostly younger. They don’t even know who I am.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.240
Honestly, we should be able to sell more than this.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.240
Let’s do it. If the buzz picks up,

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.840
we could sell a lot more tickets.
