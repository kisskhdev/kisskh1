00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.948
OUR MOVIE

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.199
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.701
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:35.953
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.040
Hyunsang.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:41.792
Snap out of it.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.468
This is who you are.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.347
There won't be anyone
left around you in the end.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.643
So if you don't want to die alone,
at least hold on to me.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.125
EPISODE 10

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.756
Being sick myself,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.218
I thought I'd know how it feels
more than anyone else.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:37.014
That's why I really wanted to play Gyuwon.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.851
I thought maybe I could
live like the lead for once.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.770
I wanted to live as an actress

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.481
and not the patient Lee Daeum.

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:50.527
So yes, I got selfish.

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:52.154
But…

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.532
every day I spend with all of you,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.785
creating one scene at a time…

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.081
means so much more to me

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.501
than simply living one more day.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.173
That's why I can't keep lying anymore.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.051
I know this is too late.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:16.803
But I'm truly sorry.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:00.305
The snow won't seem to stop, Mr. Lee.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.933
We should wrap up for today.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.395
Okay, I don't think
we can keep shooting today.

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:07.813
Thank you, everyone.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.980
Let's call it here.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.066
Hoseob, let's get the gear.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:12.943
Let's wrap it up!

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:39.219
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.598
Get the press release ready.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.142
Okay.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:49.729
Get in.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.023
Your stuff's all packed. Go back to Seoul.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.483
I'll take care of the rest.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.319
Minhee.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.214
The rumors will be everywhere
by tomorrow morning.

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:17.966
The media will be in a frenzy.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.178
This is 100% going to fall apart.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.721
Get out before it blows up.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.890
Just go on vacation
for a couple of months.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.184
I'll line up your next project
while you rest.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.729
Those couple of months of rest for me…

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.901
might be someone else's
last months of life, Ms. Go.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.612
And how is that your problem?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.947
You're going to get dragged
into Lee Jeha's madness?

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.909
I knew Daeum was sick
before we started shooting.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.163
You knew all along?

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.082
Hyeyoung.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.168
I…

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.462
want to see this movie through.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.381
If I make it to the end…

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.842
…maybe I'll find out
if this is really madness or not.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.970
What is it with this movie?

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.608
It's the first snow.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:20.946
You're right, it is.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.996
The first snow I'm seeing with you.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.378
You know what I was thinking
when I saw everyone's faces earlier?

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.047
What were you thinking?

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:41.550
We're screwed.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.846
I wanted to tell the truth

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.181
because this isn't just our movie,

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.976
it belongs to everyone.

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.604
But was it too late?

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.003
I want to be honest with our crew,

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.297
the people I care about,

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.049
about what this movie means to me

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.927
and why I am doing it.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.265
I don't want to be manipulated by someone

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.850
trying to use my illness.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.269
I've been given a death sentence,

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.272
but it's not like I committed a crime.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.152
What we chose to do might end up

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.945
hurting some people,

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.698
since we lied to people who trusted us.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.117
And when the world finds out,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.952
the movie could be over.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:55.874
But still…

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.209
I'm not letting go of this movie.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.342
I've got someone who has my back.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.303
And this time,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.097
I'll be the one who has your back, Daeum.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.442
Thank you.

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.278
For giving me the chance to speak.

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:52.764
Lee Daeum.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.352
Let's get that fever down.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.189
Doc.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.196
She's just sleeping for now.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.241
Let's get her to the hospital
when she wakes.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.992
What?

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.831
Is her condition that bad?

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.918
Why else would I be here at this hour?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.130
She can't take it any longer.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.716
She's been forcing herself through it.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.510
The meds can only hold out for so long.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.971
The checkup results…

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.557
were not good.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.726
She tricked you, Mr. Lee.

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:42.480
Jeez, she's a hell of an actress.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.783
BU SEUNGWON

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:01.041
Hey. I said, keep it under wraps.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.917
Do you even realize what you've done?

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.919
Daeum is really sick now.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.297
Can't hide it anymore, even if I want to.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.049
Did you see the crew's faces?

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.925
That's how the public will react.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.844
That "you people are nuts" look.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:18.266
I hope you thought about the fallout
before pulling that stunt.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.317
I can't decide if this deserves praise

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.651
or just screams insanity.

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.821
When you think about it,

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:36.076
Mr. Lee hasn't made anything
in five years.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:40.038
Maybe that's why
he pushed it this far.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.791
I've been watching Daeum
since her audition.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.002
Despite her state,
she must've been desperate.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.588
Even if you're desperate,
how could you do that?

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.715
And now they're dating?

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.510
What kind of mess is that?

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.386
This is between those two.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.557
We don't have to
and probably will never understand.

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.352
Honestly, I couldn't do it.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.396
I thought such difficult love
only existed in movies.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.941
Love that hard

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.276
should've just stayed in movies.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.280
Mr. Ji, I thought you'd be

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.075
on Mr. Lee's side no matter what.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.036
I understand Mr. Lee the director

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.330
making that kind of choice for his movie.

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.414
But…

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.583
Mr. Lee as a human
shouldn't have done that.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.922
You don't gamble
with someone's life like that.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.303
What's wrong?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.849
Man. What am I supposed to do,
check everyone's phones?

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.684
LOVE IN WHITE'S LEE DAEUM
IS ACTUALLY TERMINALLY ILL

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:46.062
Someone already posted it online.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.273
With reporters flocking in.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.942
Already?

00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:52.277
This day doesn't seem to end.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.029
I'll go check on Mr. Lee.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.752
Mr. Lee is with Daeum, right?

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:13.214
Excuse me. Mr. Lim?

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.800
Yes.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.761
Are you crying?

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.482
Don't cry.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.655
I had no idea.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.741
I just thought

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.493
she was really into the role.

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.247
She got dizzy a lot, and…

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.252
I just thought
I should get her some herbal medicine.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.672
Are you okay?

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.008
She was not okay at all.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.801
How did she act so well?

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:01.888
Are all actors like that?

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.974
Do they keep acting even in real life?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.018
Gosh, what do I do?

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:11.522
How can someone as clueless as me
be a manager?

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:16.945
At times like this,

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.322
you have to keep sticking by her

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:22.033
even if other managers say
you're overdoing it.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.162
That's exactly the kind of manager

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.123
Daeum needs right now.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.922
Please take care of Daeum.

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.198
Yeah.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.576
Mr. Lee, did you see outside?

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:48.661
<i>It's still snowing.</i>

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.622
We have to clear it for continuity,
but it'll take too long.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.707
<i>I see.</i>

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.709
Let's pause the shoot.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:58.129
<i>Then we'll take a few days to reset.</i>

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.007
- Hong.
- Yes, Mr. Lee?

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.091
<i>Um…</i>

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.385
How's the crew doing?

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:07.930
<i>Everyone's a little shaken.</i>

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.640
Okay, I get it.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:13.728
For now, let's send everyone back to Seoul
and take a break.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.897
I'll tell Mr. Bu myself.

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:19.817
Are you doing all right, Mr. Lee?

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.071
Since when do ADs
worry about directors? Bye.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.411
Are we pausing the shoot?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.041
You're up.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.505
It's not because of us,

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.381
it's the snow.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:47.345
It's all white.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.942
It really did snow a lot.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.362
Once the snow melts…

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.573
do you think we can keep filming?

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:12.620
We have to.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.708
We'll finish our movie.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.627
Don't worry about that.

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.675
We're past the payment date,

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.302
but haven't heard anything from Mr. Han.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.097
We have to pay our actors
their next installment,

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.851
and the crew's wages too.
What should we do?

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.686
What do you mean, what should we do?

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.521
Beg, shut it down, anything.

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.149
What about Mr. Lee?

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.359
Oh, there he is now.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.321
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, Mr. Han.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:50.408
Pardon?

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.038
Goodness, Mr. Han.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:01.085
This is all too sudden.
You could've given us a heads-up.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.296
Did you two come together?

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.131
Took forever to get here in this snow.

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:07.175
We nearly died!

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:10.511
Hey, Lee. Long time no see.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:14.765
I told you my idea last night.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:21.772
You should've given me more time.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.024
I did give you time.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.609
But

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.570
you came up
with something completely off-base.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.282
- What do you mean?
- I heard…

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:36.454
you went ahead and told the entire crew
about Lee Daeum's illness.

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.788
Huh?

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.583
I told you to call reporters
and do a flashy media show.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.044
Why'd you do it so quietly?

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.171
LOVE IN WHITE UNDER FIRE
FOR CASTING A REAL TERMINAL PATIENT

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.631
Man, Lee.

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.758
You really are something!

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.468
LOVE IN WHITE UNDER FIRE
FOR CASTING A REAL TERMINAL PATIENT

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:52.386
- Mr. Park.
- Yes?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.055
Why don't you walk around for a bit?

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.223
Should I?

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:58.226
In that case, I should go see the actors.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.436
Let's see, where are the actors?

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.190
"If she dies during the shoot,
it's a bust."

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.025
"But if she dies after, it's a jackpot."

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:10.488
That line from Mr. Bu
is what really stuck with me.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:15.243
You think you have the right
to glare at me like that?

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:19.413
Are you saying you want me replaced?

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:20.498
Yes.

00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.750
I told him to drop you, Mr. Lee.

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:24.919
To save Lee Daeum

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.922
and replace the director.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.340
Mr. Han.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.050
Replacing the director

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:34.720
is a much more complicated issue
than you think.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.807
Okay, then.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.267
Let's make it simple.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.146
If you don't replace the director,
I'll pull the investment.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.107
Is that clear enough?

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.109
What?

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.735
Can't answer right away?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.612
Think it over.

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:54.699
But…

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:59.203
isn't Lee Daeum running out of time?

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.834
Why would you meet with Daeum?

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.961
Watch your tone! Tsk.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:10.172
The investor himself reached out to me.
Isn't that enough?

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.716
What's all this?

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.636
Man, even the crew here is stiff as hell

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.305
just like you, Lee!

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.098
When I take over,

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:21.851
I'll have to replace the crew
with my own people first.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.312
Oh, and while I'm here,

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:27.023
I'd really like to meet Daeum too.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.360
I'm sure I'll get the chance soon.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.946
All right.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.781
I'll just meet Daeum next time.

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.624
Mr. Ji,
it looks like the movie's done for.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.375
What do you mean?

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.128
The investor just barged in here
with Director Park.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.547
What? Director Park is here?

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.965
That's what I'm saying.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.718
If it really comes to that, I'm out.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.470
This whole thing's a complete mess.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.431
You can't just drop out like that.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.933
Come on, Mr. Ji.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.186
What are you going to do?

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.065
Not sure.

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:16.447
Ms. Go?

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.658
I think a reporter's already here.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.535
- Let's have a look.
- Excuse me.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.287
Are you the crew from <i>Love in White</i>?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.997
No, we don't know about that.

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.585
Noh Huitae.

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:31.962
Why, Ms. Go.

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.048
What are you lurking around here for?

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.508
I'm here to cover a story.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.178
Wait, were you on set yesterday too?

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.806
In that case,
I have some questions for you.

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:44.225
If you want
to keep calling yourself a reporter,

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.102
take Seoyoung's name out of the article.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.146
Oh, come on. I can't do that.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.441
She's clearly a part of this situation.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.235
Can't take her name out?

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.444
No.

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.656
I'm going to tie her in as much as I can.

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:03.786
Are you insane?

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.748
Everyone's insane. Why can't I be too?

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.013
Director Park came by to say hi.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.224
He said he might take over.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.269
No, that's not going to happen.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.313
I told him I won't work with him.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.192
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.318
But…

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.530
I don't think I can go on with you either.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.658
When you first came to me,

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.785
you said we had to shoot this fast.

00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:49.081
At the time, I didn't understand
why that mattered so much.

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:52.460
I would've refused
if I'd known this was the reason.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.296
There are real people behind this film.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:56.839
I…

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.134
didn't think you'd ignore that.

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.471
I'm sorry,

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:06.640
but I can't do this.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.120
- Take your time.
- Okay.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.045
I have no idea
what'll happen to this movie.

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.256
What are you going to do?

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.675
I'll come back when the snow melts.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.596
He brought someone that sick into this
and made everything a mess.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.307
How could you say that?

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.101
Even when she's that sick,

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.189
even when she has so little time left,

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:58.692
she's fighting to live
and throwing everything into that role.

00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:02.238
You know that.

00:22:03.614 --> 00:22:05.074
You saw it closer than anyone.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.536
Do what you want to do.

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:10.746
As for me…

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.415
my heart keeps leaning that way.

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:31.892
You go ahead first, Daeum.

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:34.520
Take care of her, Junbyung.

00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:35.646
Don't worry. And you?

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:38.315
Yeah, I'll be there soon too.

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:40.109
I have something to handle first.

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.111
You go ahead to the hospital.

00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:44.488
When will you be there, Mr. Lee?

00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:47.700
It won't be long.

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:51.829
Don't worry about Daeum.
I'm an expert at taking care of her.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.456
Thank you,

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.083
and I'm sorry.

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:58.210
You don't need to be sorry, Mr. Lee.

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:02.214
Go ahead. Just go.

00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:07.428
See you later!

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:21.317
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:39.460
Are you mad?

00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:42.171
Then be mad, you bastard.

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.132
I gambled with someone's life,

00:23:45.215 --> 00:23:46.759
calling it a jackpot or bust.

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.012
And I just walked out

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.849
without even saying so much as a word

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.352
to that damn brat
flashing his money around.

00:23:57.645 --> 00:23:59.313
So just be mad already!

00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:01.231
I can't be mad.

00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:03.442
I'm worse than you anyway.

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:18.540
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?
He told you to fire me.

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.128
I felt sorry for you.

00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:26.131
Man, I'm going nuts.

00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:27.466
I should've just fired you,

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:29.134
put Director Park in there,

00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:32.805
and keep an eye on him to make sure
he doesn't make a different movie.

00:24:34.765 --> 00:24:36.016
But I don't want to do that.

00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:39.520
Because you saw I'm too good at this.

00:24:40.354 --> 00:24:42.523
I swear, you little…

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.321
What's this?

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:50.990
<i>Love in White</i>.

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:53.784
Yeah, I see that.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.245
Not the one you know.

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:58.038
The real <i>Love in White</i>.

00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:00.874
The <i>Love in White</i> you know

00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:04.837
is a movie Lee Duyoung made
by stealing from someone else.

00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:08.215
The name written there
is the original writer.

00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:12.386
Yu Eunae?

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:15.305
Who's Yu Eunae?

00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:16.640
Yu Eunae.

00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:19.393
My mother.

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:23.772
<i>Joke of a Love</i>,
<i>The Storm and the Stillness</i>,

00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:26.817
<i>The Weight of Love</i>, <i>The Long Goodbye</i>,
all of them…

00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:30.195
were written by my mother.

00:25:32.448 --> 00:25:35.868
I went to my childhood home
after you offered me <i>Love in White</i>,

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:38.537
and found this original draft
in the study.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.830
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:42.082
I even confirmed it with Ms. Kim Jinyeo,

00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.668
who starred in all the films
my mother wrote.

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:49.757
Gosh, that's insane.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.634
Do you realize what this means?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.554
Lee Duyoung is a legend, man.

00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:58.474
He's loved by filmmakers
from all around the world.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:03.062
A world-renowned, legendary director
had actually stolen his wife's work,

00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:06.106
and his son is exposing
the embarrassing truth.

00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:08.734
You're going public with this?

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.071
You're already drowning
in the Lee Daeum controversy.

00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:13.280
You want to completely disappear?

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.825
You might never get to direct again!

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:19.328
Let me make a proposal to you.

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:20.621
This time, could you…

00:26:22.164 --> 00:26:23.540
be the one to use me?

00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:28.962
"WHEN THE BEAST CAME TO SCHOOL"
AUDITION

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:38.847
GIVE UP YOUR LIFE TO BE A MOVIE LEAD
VS. KEEP LIVING

00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:40.724
THE FORMER? LATTER?
WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS CHOOSE?

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.976
IF I DIDN'T HAVE LONG TO LIVE,
I'D LIVE MY DREAM FIRST TOO

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.229
STILL A PAIN FOR EVERYONE
THE AUDIENCE DOESN'T DESERVE THAT

00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:49.566
<i>Must be cozy.</i>

00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:51.485
What?

00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:52.778
Just lying there to act.

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.697
You lie there,
frown a bit like you're in pain,

00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.825
and a movie
with your name on it gets released.

00:26:58.408 --> 00:26:59.660
Must be nice.

00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:00.828
You're lucky.

00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:03.330
Life must be so exciting.

00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:10.462
GWAK GYOYEONG

00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:12.881
LEE DAEUM

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:25.143
LEGEND'S SON LEE JEHA FACES BACKLASH
OVER TERMINAL PATIENT CASTING

00:27:36.113 --> 00:27:37.406
What are you filming now?

00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.118
- Cut, that's no good.
- Sorry.

00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:45.205
Just because she's taking a break
doesn't mean the actress should relax.

00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:48.500
Daeum, you have to act like it's delicious
even if it's not.

00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:49.751
You know what I mean?

00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:51.545
Hey, I swear it's good!

00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:53.589
Try it.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:57.217
Then I'll pretend
I'm doing an eating show.

00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:58.343
Hang on.

00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:02.681
<i>Hey, guys!</i>
<i>Today I'll try a yellowtail taco.</i>

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.571
It's actually good.

00:28:17.654 --> 00:28:19.781
See? I told you it's good!

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.700
It can't be. Hold on.

00:28:22.284 --> 00:28:23.660
Cut.

00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:24.953
That was totally acting.

00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:26.246
Mmm.

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:34.963
It's good, right?

00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:37.925
Come on, you liar!

00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:39.843
Go on, swallow it. Go on.

00:28:39.927 --> 00:28:41.219
Wait, of course!

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.972
Almost forgot our AD.

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:46.558
- Sorry?
- The vote's tied one to one.

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.603
If Ms. Yu says it's good,

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:51.229
you eat all the rest, okay?

00:28:51.313 --> 00:28:52.564
Okay.

00:28:52.648 --> 00:28:54.483
- All right.
- Here.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.735
Surely Ms. Yu wouldn't…

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:57.903
Would she?

00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.404
Let's see.

00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:08.664
She swallowed it.

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:11.208
- It's all right.
- See? Come over here.

00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:13.835
- Hang on.
- You promised. Finish the rest.

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.004
You just swallowed your saliva,
didn't you?

00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:17.547
You have to eat too, ma'am.

00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:19.383
- Me too?
- Ta-da!

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:20.634
Oh, wow.

00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:21.718
Ms. Yu.

00:29:21.802 --> 00:29:22.844
Yes?

00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:26.139
I heard… our crew all left.

00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:29.893
Yeah, because the snow hasn't melted.

00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:31.895
You're lying.

00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:34.231
You don't have to worry about that, Daeum.

00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:36.358
How can I not worry?

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:39.528
What's there to worry about?
Our director's Lee Jeha after all.

00:29:42.572 --> 00:29:44.574
BANK

00:29:44.658 --> 00:29:46.868
Can I apply for a loan
if I'm a freelancer?

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:49.246
Since you own property,

00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:51.373
a mortgage loan should be possible.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.167
What's the maximum amount I could get?

00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:57.379
We'll need additional documents,
so I'll guide you through that.

00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:06.471
If you bring these documents to us,
we'll assist you in more detail.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.682
Okay, thank you.

00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:11.727
I was secretly worried
that <i>Love in White</i> might get delayed.

00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:13.520
It's good that it got scrap--

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:14.855
Well, not good.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.899
You must be really disappointed.

00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.360
Sure, it's disappointing.

00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:22.320
From what I hear,

00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:24.531
everyone's ripping into Lee Jeha,

00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:26.408
but that rookie's not innocent, huh?

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.202
- Pardon?
- I heard she was the one

00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:31.246
who played up her illness
to win over the director.

00:30:32.873 --> 00:30:33.874
Sir.

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:36.710
You weren't there.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.005
Don't spread rumors like that.

00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:41.590
Oh.

00:30:42.716 --> 00:30:44.342
My bad, that came out wrong.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.429
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:59.691
You know what's going on, right?

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:02.069
I wasn't so sure at first,

00:31:02.152 --> 00:31:05.072
but the more I thought about it,
the more I wanted <i>Love in White</i>.

00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:09.326
What are you trying to say?

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:11.787
None of the crew there are my people.

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:15.665
And what, I am?

00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:18.168
Just back me up a little.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.337
If Lee Jeha won't budge,

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.131
get Seoyoung to act like she might walk.

00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:25.383
That'll shake things up fast.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.636
Do you really think

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.388
you can push Lee Jeha out?

00:31:43.193 --> 00:31:46.279
Mr. Lim, Ms. Yu, and Gyoyeong
are all in there,

00:31:46.363 --> 00:31:48.156
so it felt a bit weird.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.034
Well, well. Look at them being all cute.

00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:52.786
They're in the sweet phase.

00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:55.872
I've learned to just pretend
I don't know anything.

00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:58.333
Should we grab a drink too?

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.960
Get some snacks for Daeum on the way?

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.128
I like that idea.

00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:02.796
Get your coats!

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.843
No one's around here at this hour.

00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:10.595
Okay, but…

00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:13.557
why are we here?

00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:15.976
I wanted to be alone with you.

00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:26.069
It feels surreal.

00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.117
We used to live totally different lives

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.787
on either side of this glass,

00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:38.206
and now we're both here, looking out.

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:44.379
Did you know…

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:49.217
it's not just Gyuwon who found strength

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.387
from someone smiling outside the window.

00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:55.849
I think someone out there

00:32:56.933 --> 00:32:58.310
also found hope…

00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.355
from Gyuwon's smile.

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:10.071
Just like when you smiled at me.

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.706
Did you have a busy day?

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:24.085
Yeah, a little.

00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.255
Are you going to be busy tomorrow too?

00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:28.465
Yes.

00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:30.634
I've got a movie date with you.

00:33:35.055 --> 00:33:36.973
I'd love that.

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.605
Wow, that looks good.

00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:54.074
I can feed myself, thanks.

00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:56.660
Oh, yes. Of course.

00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:02.082
It's so good.

00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:03.333
Is it?

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.883
Daeum would love this.

00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:14.177
Mmm. Excuse me!

00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:17.138
Could we get three of these to go?

00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:19.641
- Three? Got it.
- Mmm.

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:23.270
- All right.
- Looks good.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:31.611
Hey, slow down!

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.825
It's not like I can do anything right now.

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:38.785
Might as well get completely wasted.

00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:42.497
Everyone online is going wild.

00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:45.041
What's going to happen to the movie?

00:34:50.297 --> 00:34:51.715
I don't know for sure,

00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:54.634
but I have this strange feeling

00:34:55.635 --> 00:34:57.887
like things might actually work out.

00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:00.849
I sure hope so.

00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:06.396
Hey, I saw you typing something
on your laptop earlier.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.692
Oh, that? Well, since we've got
some free time…

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:14.321
I'm writing a s-s-screenplay.

00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:16.865
What? You're writing a screenplay, Ms. Yu?

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.492
My goodness! Wow!

00:35:20.327 --> 00:35:21.786
Well, you know…

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.830
I just got the feeling

00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:27.208
I wanted to write
while I was working on this movie.

00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:30.587
That's amazing.

00:35:32.756 --> 00:35:34.007
Here's your to-go order.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.175
Ah!

00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.427
The takeout's ready.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.181
I'll just go deliver that
before it gets cold.

00:35:41.264 --> 00:35:42.474
What? No, come on.

00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:45.226
- Stay and eat with us.
- No, no.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:47.354
I don't think I should be here.

00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:48.772
- No, it's not that!
- It's fine.

00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:51.107
- We didn't mean to do that.
- No worries.

00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:53.860
I'll get going now.

00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:55.612
Enjoy the food.

00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:57.781
Have a safe trip back!

00:35:57.864 --> 00:35:58.865
Okay!

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:01.034
Man, now I feel sorry.

00:36:03.453 --> 00:36:06.206
Oh, your glass is empty. Here, let me.

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:07.332
Cheers.

00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:14.130
CINEMA JONGNO

00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:21.346
CINEMA JONGNO

00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:29.104
I have a favor to ask.

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.985
THE LONG GOODBYE

00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:39.072
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY LEE DUYOUNG

00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:49.916
Ms. Kim Jinyeo is here.

00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:53.461
<i>Will you</i>

00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:56.131
believe what I'm telling you?

00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:57.882
Yes.

00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:00.051
Please go ahead.

00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:01.428
<i>Love in White</i>

00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:03.722
was the very last thing

00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:06.182
Eunae ever asked of me.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:21.906
THE LONG GOODBYE

00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:25.034
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY LEE DUYOUNG

00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:44.679
I haven't seen you
in such a long time!

00:37:44.763 --> 00:37:46.222
- Have you been well?
- Yeah.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.641
Is that for me?

00:37:48.725 --> 00:37:50.018
I bought it just for you.

00:37:55.648 --> 00:37:58.359
What? Why does it stop here?

00:37:59.194 --> 00:38:00.653
What happens next?

00:38:00.737 --> 00:38:01.738
Do you like it?

00:38:02.322 --> 00:38:03.323
I love it.

00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:06.868
What's the ending?

00:38:07.869 --> 00:38:08.870
How does it end?

00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:11.790
I don't know either.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.666
Drink your tea.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.710
I just need to bring in the laundry.

00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:21.883
- How long will you keep doing this?
- Hmm?

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:23.635
You were born to write.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:25.929
You're too talented

00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:28.681
to live solely as Lee Duyoung's wife.

00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:30.975
I heard it'll rain soon.

00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:32.936
Let me just bring the laundry in.

00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:48.827
HYUNSANG AND GYUWON BOTH SMILE.
THE END.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.453
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:01.631
This script…

00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:06.052
It's…

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.889
It's going to be a masterpiece.
I can just feel it.

00:39:11.724 --> 00:39:14.727
And I want you
to be the one to direct it too.

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:16.688
Speaking of which,

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.232
could you…

00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:22.443
let me have this script one last time?

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:25.071
You know,

00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:27.532
since the name "Yu Eunae"

00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:30.285
isn't really well-known to the public.

00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:33.496
And if people find out you're my wife,

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.748
I'm afraid they might

00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:38.793
doubt everything I've made so far.

00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:40.712
But it's not doubt.

00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:43.089
It's the truth.

00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:44.173
Oh, honey.

00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:45.800
My success means…

00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:50.138
the success of our family, isn't it?

00:40:39.729 --> 00:40:40.980
MEDICINE

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.907
DIAGNOSIS - METASTASIS CONFIRMED

00:40:52.075 --> 00:40:53.368
DUYOUNG CAUGHT IN AFFAIR
WITH KIM JINYEO

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:55.954
Eunae, it's me.

00:40:56.037 --> 00:40:57.914
Please open the door, Eunae.

00:40:57.997 --> 00:41:00.458
You know none of this is true.

00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:08.633
I told Lee Duyoung

00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:11.302
to give you your scripts back,

00:41:11.928 --> 00:41:13.304
and now this filthy rumor…

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.685
You idiot.

00:41:19.394 --> 00:41:21.312
Do you think I'd believe that trash?

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:24.732
Come on.

00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:25.817
My dear Jinyeo…

00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:33.658
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:35.868
I won't do it.

00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:37.912
I can't do it.

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.957
Jinyeo, please. Do it for me.

00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:43.042
You're this sick,

00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:45.211
but that man Lee Duyoung…

00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:48.297
He doesn't matter.

00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:50.383
If you finish this for me…

00:41:52.468 --> 00:41:53.928
I'd be very happy.

00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:56.139
I'll expose everything.

00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:58.933
No, you can't.

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.477
Everyone will just call you a liar.

00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:02.979
I don't care.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.275
<i>Love in White…</i>

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:10.611
has all of me in it.

00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:14.991
It'll probably be my last work.

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.995
Jinyeo,
you've always been my leading lady.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.040
I really want you to do this.

00:42:22.123 --> 00:42:23.958
Eunae…

00:42:25.043 --> 00:42:28.337
I want nothing else than to see you…

00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:31.883
…play Gyuwon.

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:35.219
And one day,

00:42:35.845 --> 00:42:37.722
when the time feels right…

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:41.476
Oh, gosh.

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:44.771
Could you…

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.732
show this script to Jeha?

00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:50.234
I'm sure he'll know

00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:54.322
exactly what his mother meant
when she wrote it.

00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:02.914
You'll do that, right?

00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:09.837
Thank you.

00:43:11.172 --> 00:43:12.173
Thank you.

00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:17.136
Thank you so much.

00:43:25.311 --> 00:43:27.897
THE SHADOWS OF OBJECTS THAT ENDURED
AND EXISTED THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF TIME

00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:34.070
When I heard Eunae's son
was remaking the film,

00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:36.656
I thought maybe
this was the time she meant.

00:43:40.576 --> 00:43:41.828
Are you feeling all right?

00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:43.412
I'm not in any pain at all.

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:45.331
I'm doing very well, ma'am.

00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:52.421
- Your name is Lee Daeum?
- Yes.

00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:55.216
What a beautiful name.

00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:58.302
My mom gave it to me.

00:43:58.386 --> 00:43:59.804
Ah.

00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:25.079
Remember this place?

00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:29.208
Where we had that intense first meeting.

00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:41.929
The terminal patient, Lee Daeum.

00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:49.061
The look on your face was priceless.

00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:51.606
What look did I make?

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:53.733
"Who the heck is this woman?"

00:44:54.734 --> 00:44:56.027
"She's a nutjob."

00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:57.612
I didn't…

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:04.785
I guess I made that look.

00:45:14.086 --> 00:45:15.338
I've been thinking.

00:45:16.172 --> 00:45:19.967
My father stole my mother's script
to make his movie,

00:45:20.051 --> 00:45:21.761
and I inherited that.

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:27.016
So I don't think you showing up to me
was a coincidence.

00:45:29.477 --> 00:45:31.145
You once said

00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:34.899
that people don't realize
how precious the present is,

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:36.859
that they're idiots.

00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:39.028
Everyone!

00:45:39.862 --> 00:45:42.156
You think you have a lot of days to live?

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.450
You think you'll live forever?

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.496
All the moments you just let slip away

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:51.290
are like romance or fantasy films to me!

00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:54.961
But you'll keep on living
without knowing that!

00:45:55.544 --> 00:45:59.507
You idiots!

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.008
<i>I was that idiot.</i>

00:46:02.843 --> 00:46:05.930
After <i>The Lonely People</i> became a hit,
I spent the last five years…

00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:10.518
dragging myself through hell.

00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:12.895
I kept questioning

00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:15.940
if it was my talent
or my father's name carrying me.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.151
But in the end, that was meaningless.

00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:23.322
My father's reputation turned out
to be nothing more than a lie.

00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:29.537
I let that trap me
and ended up wasting my precious time.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.167
Like an idiot.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.712
Thank you.

00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:40.798
For living like every second counts.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.219
And for putting everything
into your performance.

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:48.848
My mother and <i>Love in White</i>…

00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:51.600
I think I understand now.

00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:58.274
Maybe the time she spent writing
was the most important time of her life.

00:47:00.443 --> 00:47:01.819
Just like this is for you.

00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:13.789
Mr. Lee.

00:47:14.332 --> 00:47:16.375
I don't think it was a coincidence

00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:20.504
that I desperately clung to you
so I could be in this movie,

00:47:21.464 --> 00:47:23.299
that I found the courage to do that,

00:47:23.966 --> 00:47:27.803
that you found out the truth
about your mother at that exact moment

00:47:27.887 --> 00:47:31.807
and decided to make <i>Love in White</i>
differently from your father's.

00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:35.561
Those weren't coincidences at all.

00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:41.859
At that moment,
we both chose to live differently.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.822
And in doing so, we chose each other.

00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:56.957
Thank you for showing up at that moment.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.549
And thank you…

00:48:06.759 --> 00:48:08.427
for giving in to me at that moment.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.919
I'll be back soon. See you.

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:44.296
There's something only I can do.

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.592
Mr. Lee.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.220
Don't try to carry it all on your own.

00:48:54.056 --> 00:48:55.182
I'm not on my own.

00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:27.256
MS. CHAE SEOYOUNG

00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:32.761
MS. CHAE, HAVE YOU EATEN?
I'M HUNGRY BUT HAVE NO ONE TO EAT WITH.

00:49:34.597 --> 00:49:37.725
I'LL GO TO YOU. LET'S EAT TOGETHER.

00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:40.895
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:44.857
Hey, are we getting catering
or lunch boxes?

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.817
<i>They said lunch boxes.</i>

00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:49.778
I'll just eat <i>ramyeon</i>.

00:49:50.738 --> 00:49:51.906
Goodness.

00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:54.241
Man, I'd love to eat some proper food.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.164
The food was really good
in Samcheok, wasn't it?

00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:01.707
You scared me.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.250
<i>Daddy!</i>

00:50:04.293 --> 00:50:05.294
She's adorable.

00:50:05.961 --> 00:50:08.756
You should bring her on set
when we start shooting again.

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:10.841
Show her the sea too.

00:50:15.429 --> 00:50:16.430
Must be heavy.

00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:18.724
Mr. Lee.

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:28.067
I had something to say to you.

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.742
Could I get a cup of coffee from you?

00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:46.919
I know I've put you through a lot.

00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.673
Why are you worrying about me?

00:50:50.756 --> 00:50:53.801
I don't care if people say
that I've gone crazy

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.887
and exploited someone's life for a movie.
Let them talk.

00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:58.514
Thick skin, huh?

00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:01.642
That's actually quite reassuring.

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.811
But I'm not okay with disappointing you

00:51:04.353 --> 00:51:07.398
and not bringing myself
to stop you from walking away.

00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:09.650
That's been eating at me.

00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:14.280
- Mr. Lee.
- I can handle criticism from the world…

00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:18.576
but the disappointed faces of our crew…

00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:21.704
That, I couldn't bear.

00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:26.333
That truly scared me.

00:51:29.962 --> 00:51:31.130
I…

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.593
…used to think
that as long as the film got made,

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.263
it didn't matter how we got there.

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.600
But after seeing Daeum…

00:51:45.394 --> 00:51:47.730
and seeing the crew
working on this film with us…

00:51:49.398 --> 00:51:51.942
I realized that the process
of making a movie…

00:51:55.154 --> 00:51:57.072
could be someone's entire life.

00:51:58.324 --> 00:51:59.617
That time…

00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:05.456
could be the most important time
of their life.

00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:08.751
I came to realize that.

00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:11.712
I believe

00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:14.715
that it's not just Daeum, but myself,

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:18.093
you, and everyone on this movie's crew

00:52:18.927 --> 00:52:23.515
who are giving this movie
the best parts of our lives.

00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:27.186
Could you please give me

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.814
one more chance to take responsibility

00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:33.776
for those precious moments?

00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:48.832
<i>I love you, Seoyoung!</i>

00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:50.918
<i>Thanks for the food.</i>

00:52:52.544 --> 00:52:54.755
Do you know you were kind of scary here?

00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:57.049
- I was?
- Yeah.

00:52:57.132 --> 00:52:58.467
Total movie star energy.

00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:04.306
I actually kept thinking
about you after that

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:06.475
and went, "I should've gotten her number."

00:53:06.558 --> 00:53:08.686
"How can I pay her back
for the sandwich now?"

00:53:09.561 --> 00:53:11.271
But you already paid me back.

00:53:13.732 --> 00:53:15.693
You didn't just call me here
to eat, did you?

00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:21.865
Go on, tell me.

00:53:23.409 --> 00:53:26.161
I'm so jealous of you, Ms. Chae.

00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:31.458
I really love acting, you know.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.753
I've dreamed about it for so long.

00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.755
And then…

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.677
I got to work with you,
my favorite actress,

00:53:42.177 --> 00:53:44.054
on this movie.

00:53:44.972 --> 00:53:47.850
At first, I thought that was enough.
My wish had come true.

00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:49.935
But it wasn't enough.

00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:55.524
I just kept wanting more.

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:59.236
That's why I'm so insanely jealous of you.

00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:02.406
You get to have another movie,

00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:04.324
and another one,

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:07.661
and another one after that.

00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:19.047
Actually…

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:25.262
I've been jealous of you
since the moment I met you.

00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:31.310
Figuring out why Lee Jeha
cast you as Gyuwon…

00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:35.230
only took me three seconds.

00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:43.197
Let's keep being jealous of each other.

00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:45.782
Daeum,

00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:49.495
you're the kind of actor
that makes me want to bring my A-game.

00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:51.830
Really?

00:54:51.914 --> 00:54:53.373
Yeah.

00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:55.209
In that case, Ms. Chae…

00:54:56.168 --> 00:54:58.837
I'll give you everything I've got
until the end.

00:55:00.881 --> 00:55:01.882
Now you're scaring me.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:05.511
Eat up, then.

00:55:05.594 --> 00:55:07.387
- Yes!
- You need food to fight.

00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:11.433
Prepare for battle!

00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:13.435
I won't lose!

00:55:16.104 --> 00:55:17.314
Mmm.

00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:26.490
<i>Let me make a proposal to you.</i>

00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:29.535
This time, could you be the one to use me?

00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:33.247
That annoying little…

00:55:35.374 --> 00:55:37.626
BEST DIRECTOR, BEST SCREENPLAY

00:55:38.627 --> 00:55:41.505
Well… It's every man for himself, right?

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.549
You do you…

00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:45.342
and I'll do me.

00:55:52.057 --> 00:55:53.267
Hey, Mr. Noh!

00:55:53.976 --> 00:55:57.813
I know I messed up last time.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.982
I'm sorry.

00:56:00.065 --> 00:56:03.110
But I've got something big
that'll make up for it.

00:56:03.819 --> 00:56:05.195
Are you interested?

00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:15.914
It's okay. It's all right.

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:20.377
No!

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.588
Tell Mr. Lee to leave.

00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:24.715
Tell Mr. Lee to leave.

00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:26.592
Please…

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.098
Was it your first time
seeing her like that?

00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:35.475
Yes.

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:37.311
You must've been shocked.

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.313
Yes, I was.

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.776
Then walk away. It's all right.

00:56:48.947 --> 00:56:50.532
No, I won't do that.

00:56:52.784 --> 00:56:54.494
You won't? Then what?

00:56:55.621 --> 00:56:57.748
I will stay by Daeum's side.

00:57:04.713 --> 00:57:07.257
Have you ever lost someone you loved?

00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:12.554
Yes, when I was little.

00:57:12.638 --> 00:57:14.014
My mother.

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:15.641
And how did that feel?

00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:16.767
No,

00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:18.602
are you okay now?

00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:20.854
No, it's like…

00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:23.023
Some days I'm living fine…

00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:29.696
but then I suddenly get pulled back
into that memory.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.825
Yes, that's right.

00:57:35.744 --> 00:57:38.413
That's what it's like
to lose someone you love.

00:57:39.748 --> 00:57:41.375
No matter how much time passes,

00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:44.002
it never really goes away.

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:47.381
I remember

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:49.591
what you told me.

00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:54.554
That loving someone who knows
when they're going to die…

00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:01.520
…is something the one left behind
will carry forever.

00:58:07.693 --> 00:58:10.529
That's why I'm going to stay
with Daeum until the end.

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:14.241
If I have to carry that

00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:16.952
forever anyway…

00:58:19.371 --> 00:58:20.872
If I won't be able to forget…

00:58:25.585 --> 00:58:27.796
I want that to be Daeum.

00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:37.347
Then let me ask you this.

00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:42.436
Please…

00:58:43.437 --> 00:58:45.772
help Daeum see this movie

00:58:46.898 --> 00:58:48.233
through to the end.

00:58:54.906 --> 00:58:56.116
I'm counting on you.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.987
Mr. Lee.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.114
<i>Did you just go home yesterday?</i>

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.409
Yes, I heard you didn't want to see me.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:23.954
It's not that.

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:28.124
I just didn't want you
to see me like that.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.377
I'll pick you up in the afternoon.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:32.838
Are we going somewhere?

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:36.132
Mmm.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.218
Somewhere that's like the hospital to you.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.427
Sorry?

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:42.264
Dad.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:44.432
I'm really leaving now.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:46.142
Right, sure.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:52.107
Oh, come on.

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:55.402
This is embarrassing
for a doctor like you.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.237
Wash your coat once in a while.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.781
Daeum.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:02.826
I…

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.871
really want to see the movie you're in.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:09.583
I know I'm saying this too late.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:13.211
So go ahead
and do everything you want to do.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:16.214
I'm already doing all that.

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:17.340
Good.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.595
You know she can't skip meals, right?

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:25.557
She eats a lot. Hope you understand.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.058
I'll take good care of her.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:28.727
Now, go.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:45.410
Get out of here.

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.208
Go.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:19.861
Go ahead.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.197
Mmm.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.925
Daeum, you're here.

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:45.637
Your face is even paler than before.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.473
What would you do without my makeup?

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.558
The lighting helps too, you know.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.395
I can't believe
houses like this still exist.

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:55.271
This place makes my heart pound.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.607
Isn't it amazing?
You should take some photos.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.401
Yeah, use them as a reference.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.319
Daeum.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:03.822
I'm glad you're here.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.535
Welcome.

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:27.762
What do I do?

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.142
I don't know what to do.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:34.519
I really want to live.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.531
Mr. Lee.

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.452
I want to live so badly.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.974
<i>Whether I disappear from</i>
<i>the industry or get canceled,</i>

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.434
I'll deal with that myself.

01:04:56.518 --> 01:04:57.894
You just use me

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:00.772
to be the good producer
who's only looking out for the movie.

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:03.399
How insane do they have to be?

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:06.444
I feel sorry for Daeum,
but this is important to me too.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.490
Seoyoung and Jungwoo's agencies
said they can't clear their schedules.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.034
I heard talks of Director Park
gathering his crew.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:14.994
What's Mr. Bu doing?

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.914
I'm also worried like hell
that Lee Daeum might die.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:24.587
<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:28.258
I hope you don't see Daeum's time
as only pain

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.344
and that this is not too hard on you.

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:34.806
