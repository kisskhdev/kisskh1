00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.976
Your Americano is ready.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.100
Enjoy.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.176
Excuse me.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.320
Sorry.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.200
(Han Enzhi sent a video) (Han
Enzhi|Joonhee Is this you? Oh my…)

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.786
(Who are you talking
to?) (Are you ignoring me?)

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.900
(Do you think reporting to the police will make
this video disappear?) (You're finished) (You bitch)

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.626
Sorry, we're closed for the day.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.266
I put it in a takeout cup for you.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.490
Sorry.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.650
This…

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.470
Seems like you dropped it earlier.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.290
It's not mine.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.810
Ah… then I'll just leave it here.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.900
Since I found it here anyway.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.480
《S LINE》 (A red line connecting
people who have had sexual relations)

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.920
Have you been waiting long?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.110
Is something wrong?

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.140
Ah, right.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.116
Happy birthday!

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.840
Even though it's not midnight yet.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.990
I wanted to properly
celebrate your birthday.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.560
I have a favor to ask you.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.490
What is it?

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.530
If you're not comfortable, you can say no.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.290
I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do.

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.930
I don't want to pressure you.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.490
It's just…

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.680
If I'm going to be with someone,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.120
I hope that person can be you.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.570
I have a question.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.180
Hmm.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.140
Do you like me?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.620
Hmm.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.896
Ah, right

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.210
I don't have that thing.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.540
Ah...

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.120
Do you mean this?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.910
That's amazing.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.950
I think so too.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.100
What's wrong?

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.420
Nothing.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.036
Hungry?

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.340
Let's go get something to eat.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.770
Sure.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.240
Ah, but it's almost the last train time.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.640
Well...

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.766
Wait here for me.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.790
Okay.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.400
What should I do?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.720
(Private Property No Trespassing)

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.280
I've always thought I was a cursed child.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.150
The child who killed his parents.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.840
I want to make a change.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.200
But.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.990
Nothing changed.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.930
I'm cursed.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.110
And those who are with me.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.390
Will all die.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.526
(Number not displayed Happy 17th Birthday
You're invited to the birthday party)

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:53.090
(Happy 17th Birthday! You're
invited to the Boundary Room)

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.630
Detective...

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.290
Please help me.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.470
Sena's S-line.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.780
Do you really not know?

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.580
If I knew.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.980
I would have told you.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.080
Damn.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.960
I...

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.600
Every year on my birthday.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.570
I receive a card.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.300
Even though no one sends it.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.410
At first, I thought it was my mom.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.590
At some point, I realized.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.870
Someone is always waiting for my birthday.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.070
One day, I'll have to do something.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.700
And I think.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.800
That day is today.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.750
(Happy 17th Birthday! You're
invited to the Boundary Room)

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.700
Called you to school.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.180
Gave me these glasses.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.720
And Sena…

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.730
Now, it's all the same
person's doing, right?

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.486
Would anyone be at school at this time?

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.566
I checked your homeroom teacher's
identity, and there's no such person

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.000
Lee Gyu-jin doesn't exist at all.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.696
The only option now is to visit the
school and see if we can find anything...

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.116
Detective.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.300
Over there.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.440
Hey, sunglasses.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.560
I almost lost my life.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.086
What happened?

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.590
Who did this?

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.090
Didn't you tell me to come to the school?

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.640
But I don't remember what happened next...

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.720
Did something happen to you?

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.490
I'll tell you later.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.537
What?

00:18:06.561 --> 00:18:08.080
Let's leave first.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.200
I came with a detective.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.310
Detective.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.600
Detective.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.780
Let's go.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.290
What's going on? Where did she run off to?

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.250
What's happening?

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.376
Weren't we going downstairs?

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.230
Damn it, let's go.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.986
What's going on?

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.700
Why is it the same floor again?

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.780
Help!

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.350
It seems like we're...

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.050
We're trapped in the school.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.950
Trapped?

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.140
How could this be?

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.320
(Restricted area)

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.890
Rooftop.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.100
What?

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.770
There's no one here.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.360
Hello?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.570
Isn't there anyone here at all?

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.240
Meeting that lady.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.680
Was my greatest fortune.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.920
This... seems like what
you dropped earlier.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.730
Did you purposely bring this to me?

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.710
How do you feel now?

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520
What?

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.340
Do you still want to die?

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.620
Or maybe...

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.310
Want to kill someone?

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.090
What do you mean by that?

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.720
You know the line on your head.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.290
Represents something, don't you?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.910
Don't you want to get rid of it?

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.160
Those red lines.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.386
The world Junhee sees with glasses.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.196
Will be seen by everyone.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.856
Very soon.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.340
Even without glasses.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.316
Aren't you curious.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.570
When that time comes.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.580
What will people do?

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.150
For some, it will be an
undeniable weakness.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.456
And others will exploit that.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.760
That's why.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.150
I'm here to help Junhee.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.660
After that.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.630
I regained my sense of purpose in life.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.186
Now

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.650
I will sever my final sin.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.160
When the world is covered in crimson.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.300
All of us...

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.880
Everyone will be reborn.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.260
Junhee.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.416
I'm sorry I hurt you.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.120
Please don't act this way.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.180
You know how much I love you...

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.570
Kyungjin.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.160
There's something I haven't told you.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.880
Actually, I

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.170
I've been able to see
strange things since birth.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.570
You mean this.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.080
Is it something strange?

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.160
I think it's wonderful.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.030
Where did you get your glasses?

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.040
Kyungjin, take them off - No.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.300
But.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.750
I heard that if you die, you can
see the S-line even without glasses.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.230
Is it true?

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.040
What?

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.120
That's what the teacher told me.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.510
The teacher?

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.350
Lee Kyu-jin.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.030
Dad.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.240
Don't you want to save Sana?

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.740
No.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.930
Put down the knife.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.480
I'm telling you to put down the knife.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.770
Detective.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.960
How is the world with glasses on?

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.100
Don't you think it's beautiful?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.710
If we wait a little longer

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.100
the whole world will soon
be covered in crimson.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.580
Ordinary people can't kill me.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.160
Did you push Sana off the roof?

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.970
If Sana wasn't in the hospital now

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.760
would you really take a proper look at her?

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.910
I'm giving you a chance.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.990
Move aside.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.190
No way.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.640
Where is this place?

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.270
Your cheek...

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.570
Why did your eyes change color?

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.450
Stop it.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.520
Why are you doing this?

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.270
You've always been curious, right?

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.440
Why were you born with
the ability to see the red line?

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.060
It was all for today, Hyun-yup.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.506
You're not cursed.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.126
You're both a gift and a blessing.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.590
Stop lying.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.530
People are killing each other.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.950
Friends and family are dead.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.360
With these events happening.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.290
How can seeing the S-line be a blessing?

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.260
People are curious.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.090
Don't you understand yet, Hyun-yup?

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.170
The S-line.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.190
Haven't you sensed the desire in
people who want to see the S-line?

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.900
I'm just the voice for those desires.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.210
Mom.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.570
I'm sorry.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.050
I'm sorry.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.580
I'm too late.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.570
I also have…

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.630
Those glasses.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.686
Sister, you're here - Yeah.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.160
Have you eaten?

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.520
Darling, what's wrong?

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.790
Xianxi.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.780
It's not your fault.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.680
Hey.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.940
Your death

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.920
will bless humanity with the Divine Eye.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.720
It's too late.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.320
I've already…

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.440
Proven your reason for existence.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:50.980
Both of us

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.900
have done everything we should.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.720
Huh - Oh my - Oh my…

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.600
Glasses…

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:41.810
Xianxi.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.740
Are you alright?

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.990
Let's go first, let's go back.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.250
Detective.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:14.260
Detective.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.340
Let's visit Seon-a together.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.376
Wow, it's really beautiful.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.246
Oh my - Wow.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.790
The sky turned red.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960
Look at his head.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:05.090
Oh my...

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.880
What is it? What is it?

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.160
Oh my goodness.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.296
- What is this?
- What's happening?

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.866
Oh my -What is it?

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.046
You seem to have one too.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.560
- Huh?
- What's going on?

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.100
You've got one on your head too.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.070
One day.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.980
Everyone will see the world you've seen.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.800
Everyone will be able to
see the world of the S-line

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.470
I've finally become the ordinary
person I always wanted to be.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.406
The whole world was
in chaos for nearly a year.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.530
Even though everyone wanted to understand.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.466
Why these S-lines suddenly appeared.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.066
No one could find the answer.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.690
Sun-ah eventually woke up from her coma.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.760
In this world filled with S-lines.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.530
She became the person without S-lines.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.220
Goodbye.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.046
Sun-ah and Detective Han.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.640
Never asked each other any questions.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.280
They simply.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.466
Were grateful to see each other alive.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.950
Didn't I tell you not to come over?

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.750
What do you want to eat?

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.420
No way, eating with you is so embarrassing.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.050
What do you mean? How is it embarrassing?

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.656
Look up at the line above your head.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.216
Didn't you see?

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.150
Everyone is staring at you.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.120
And then, as for me.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.040
I'm all alone again.
