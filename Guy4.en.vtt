- Yes, Mr. Chairman.
- What's her name?

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.339
Oh.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.383
Her name is Kang Miyoung.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.552
We've newly hired her through an audition.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:35.554
I like her.

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.849
There's something

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:42.436
touching about her voice.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.522
I think she deserves a bigger stage.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.274
That's right.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.985
I went the extra mile to hire her.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.069
Good job.

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:53.113

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.928
So, how did it go?

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:19.931
No, I...

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.433
Sir.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.270
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:26.355
Bye.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.154
Where is the Chairman?

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.822
He's in the holding cell.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.868
<i>Mr. Kim Changsoo.</i>

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.163
Who are you?

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.832
We're from the Narcotics Team
of Myoungsan Police Station.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.085
Drugs? You've got to be kidding me.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.087
Things better not go south.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.630
And do you have a warrant?

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.048
Hey, search carefully.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.425
Here it is. We found it.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.970
Goodness. This is not good.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.099
All right. Let's handcuff him.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:04.935
What the heck?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.854
He did drugs? That's ridiculous.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.649
This is a setup. Someone is framing him.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.945
It's obvious who's behind this.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.530
Right?

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.699
The Chairman should've listened to me.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.618
When he left to start his own gang,
we should've taken him down.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.080
What should we do about this rat?

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.373
Should we just wipe them all out?

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.293
We'll need evidence or reasons
to wipe them out.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.172
Wait a bit. I'll check
if this is Kang Taehoon's doing.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.049
Damn it.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.745
Put this in an envelope
and hand it to her.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.124
- Tell her she did a good job.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.335
- Oh, right.
- Yes?

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:14.629
Why don't you

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.132
change her slot?

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:18.842
Pardon me?

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.556
Well...

Miyoung, great job.

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:34.941
Thank you.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.861
Miyoung, good job.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.322
The customers loved it.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.573
Really?

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.200
What a relief. Thank you.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.911
Hold on. Good job today. Take this.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.872
- What is it?
- Look inside.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.586
This is from the Chairman,
especially for you.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.546
Who is the Chairman? This is so much.

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.882
You don't know?

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.636
He's the big shot
of Myoungsan City.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.723
He said he loved your performance.

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:09.059
I see,

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.603
but is it okay to take this much--

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.980
And guess what he said.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.858
He wants you on the main stage
from next time.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.069
What?

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:23.323
- Really?
- Of course!

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.242
No way! Thank you. Oh, my goodness.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.870
- Thank you.
- Anyway, greet him when you run into him.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:29.955
Okay.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.585
Seokcheol, I seriously don't remember
how I performed.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.712
No, you did well when I was there.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.172
<i>I expected I'd be this nervous,</i>

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:41.508
but when I went up on stage,
it was pretty okay.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.177
<i>And I have great news.</i>

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.472
From tomorrow, they want me
on the main stage at 9:00 p.m.

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:48.682
<i>Really?</i>

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.100
That's great.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.477
See? Everyone can tell.

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.688
<i>I'll have to do even better.</i>

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.314
You must be tired.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.816
Go home and rest up.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.985
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.946
Okay. Be careful on your way.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.906
- Text me when you get there.
<i>- Take care.</i>

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:43.278
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.707
I'm going to quit this life.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:02.172
I don't know what I'll do after,
but anything will be better than this.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.465
I'm sick and tired of it.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.845
Good thinking.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.642
Shouldn't you say
"Good job" or "It must've been tough"?

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:23.670

Are you going somewhere?

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:51.781
Yes. Daegi's boiler broke down.
I'm off to see if I can repair it.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.453
Hey.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.164
Did you mean what you said last night?

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.167
You said you'd quit.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.753
Yes, of course.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.049
Good thinking.

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.809
Did you tape it thoroughly?

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.352
Yes, I did.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.437
Come out now.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.607
Oh, it's all taken care of.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.610
Go and check if hot water comes out.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:33.198
He keeps it off all winter

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.242
and only starts turning it on and off
as spring comes.

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:38.286
It makes the boiler malfunction.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.330
Watch what you say around him.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.916
- Hurry up and check the water.
- Fine.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.918
Go on and check. Hot water will come out.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.631
Sir, are you that happy?

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.467
- What are you saying?
- Gosh.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.220
When you walked through that gate
earlier today,

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.679
you were grinning from ear to ear.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.099
I thought you won a lottery or something.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.601
If it makes you that happy,

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:06.064
you should've told him to quit
a long time ago.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.148
Tsk!

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.277
Honestly, I was too afraid to tell him.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:15.907
In case he said I didn't have the right
to tell him such a thing.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.077
I hesitated
and ended up missing the right time.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:24.332
But now that he's made up his mind,
I feel so relieved.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:30.171
Yes, he made the right decision
before it was too late.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:35.093
By the way, what is he going to do
once he quits being a gangster?

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:38.304
Damn you. He's young enough,
he can do anything for a living.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.557
A gangster, my foot.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.975
I mean...

The drug test results came out negative.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.278
That's good. It's as we expected.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.697
Look into what happened
while I visit the Chairman.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.575
Once he's released,
he'll want to know who was behind it.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.785
Okay, I'll do that.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.036

Hello! I'm Jang Wooseok.
I'm a 42nd graduate of Myoungsan High.

There's no need to shout.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.765
I came to give you this.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.100
What is it?

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.977
It's my book report on Kim Ku.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.896
You said you'd take me in if I wrote it.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.192
Do you have good grades?

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.152
No, sir.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.362
- Are you a bottom-rank student?
- No.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.990
I'm, like, second or third
from the bottom.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:40.575
I see.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.327
Get yourself within the top 10.

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.788
Will you let me join the group, then?

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:46.873
Yes.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.293
Just tell me you won't!

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:54.005
- Make it within the top 10.
- Well...

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.717
Good-bye, sir!

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:02.180
Who is that kid?

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:03.973
I've been keeping an eye on him.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.934
He's the number-one high school fighter
in this town.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.020

What? Why do you ask?

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.245
Hey, you punk.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:28.539
If a friend asks you something,
just give him an answer.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.834
- Then, let me ask you something too.
- What is it?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.045
Yesterday, my boss...

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.664
Who... Gosh.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.793
Who is it?

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:16.379
Ms. Park Seokkyung.

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.299
- Yes?
- This is the police.

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.427
If you don't open the door,
I'll break in.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.178
Open the door.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.937
Who are you looking for, again?

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:35.523
Ms. Park Seokkyung.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.153
Oh, that person doesn't live here.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.946
I think she does.

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.323
Do I seem that easy to you?

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.659
You think I wouldn't even recognize
my first love?

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.746
It's me, Byeongsoo.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.330
Byeongsoo?

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.669
Goodness gracious.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.172
You're crazy.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.340
You freaked me out.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.633
I was just kidding.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.802
You can't joke around like that.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:05.928
You're an actual cop.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.347
Back in the day,
I used to tease you and run away too.

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:11.809
Jeez, you scared the heck out of me.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.062
Hey.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.314
Am I really your first love?

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:17.982
You didn't know?

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:21.319
Well, I just thought you kind of liked me.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:22.820
First love, my foot.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:26.699
But thanks

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.243
for having me as your first love.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:33.164
Gosh. I didn't expect myself
to be this romantic either.

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:34.499
I still have a crush on you.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.210
Hey, I'm a mom now.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:39.879
So what if you're a mom?
Am I not allowed to like a mom?

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.047
My goodness.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:42.965
Do you even hear yourself?

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.634
You're weird.

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.469
Gosh.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.641
You're in a lot of trouble, aren't you?

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.603
Seokcheol told me about it briefly.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.650
So, you know my whole situation.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.029
If I help you with those issues,
will you do me one favor?

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.200
- What favor?
- It's no fun if I tell you in advance.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.244
You have to promise me first.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:13.663
- Come on.
- What the...

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.249
- Here, promise.
- What...

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.043
You've given me your word now.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.336
Hey, this is too one-sided.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.592
Goodness.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.012
I'm off.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:36.102
Gosh. What's with that guy?

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.690
And why is my heart racing?

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.692
Goodness.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:44.902
Calm down.

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.029
Chill out.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.790
Have this one. Don't eat this.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.250
How sour is it?

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:04.547
Jeez! This is too sour!

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.551
You look good, Mom.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.477
Mom, it was probably our fate
to come back to this neighborhood.

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.272
You know, sometimes,

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:25.234
you belatedly return
to your predestined path.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.071
When I left this neighborhood,

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.866
I thought everything was cut off from me.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.786
I felt like I'd never be able to go back
to the way things were before.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.123
I felt as if I was lost.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.584
I felt like I'd lost everything.

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:43.544
You,

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.132
and the man I liked.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.102
Don't be sick, Mom.
Everything will be okay now.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.064
You'll support me, right?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.525
- Yes.
- Thank you.

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:10.821
Eat slowly, Mom, like this. Have this one.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.953
I feel sorry for our Changsoo.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.038
He should've settled for a small company
and retired.

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.373
Why did he have to challenge us?

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.044
Mr. Yoo, visit OSEON
and hand them our estimate again today.

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.879
We'll get that third district back.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:29.173
I bet they're quite scared.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:30.383
Yes, sir.

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:32.718
Go back to work.

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:51.696
I'm listening.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.823
Did you look into it?

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.539
Jaebong, go quickly.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:09.255
Hey, Cheonho.

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.048
Stand here.

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:16.804
Stand properly, you punk.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:24.478
You should've at least let me know
before you made a move.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:29.025
The Chairman wanted me
to keep it a secret.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.109
As if.

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.406
Then you can take the fall alone.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.286
Report everything to me from now on.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.079
Got it?

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:50.212
SEOKCHEOL

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:53.966
You're dismissed.

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:03.684
Hello, sir.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.561
Yes.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.271
Oh, I'm a little busy today--

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.150
Yes, sir.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:14.278
Yes.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.447
So, there's that thing?

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.657
NILBANA MANAGER YOON ILJOONG

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.241
Wait.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.411
Go on. What's the name?

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.748
"Little Singing Room"?

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.835
Okay, got it. Bye.

Yes, I did.

So, you did.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:24.098
You actually did.
Are you going to get serious?

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:25.975
What are you talking about?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.062

You've become like magnets

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.154
- No...
- Are you in a relationship?

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:41.824
No, not at all. We're not there yet.

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.161
You know, we're just open
to what's going to happen next.

Good luck to both of you.

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:51.125
Is my credibility still the same?

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:54.754
No, it's gone up
now that you're seeing my brother.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.132
I wish all the best
for both you and my brother.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.801
You may not know,

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.596
but he wouldn't be like this
had he not gotten expelled.

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.849
He dropped out of school?

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.560
He got expelled, he didn't drop out.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:11.854
I didn't know.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.941
Mmm, it happened
after you transferred schools.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:18.694
He caused a serious problem.

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.197
Remember those bullies from Sungpo High?

00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:23.783
He went to their school,

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.619
broke all the windows, and beat them up.
It was crazy.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:30.664
He almost got sent to a reformatory,
and ended up getting expelled.

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:33.459
<i>No way.</i>

00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:34.919
He used to be a nerd.

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:36.921
I don't know what made him
suddenly do that.

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:38.088
Why are you doing this?

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.760
If not for that,
his life would've been different.

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:50.726
What is it?

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.270
What? No, nothing.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.038
I'll see you there later.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:24:59.665
Okay, bye.

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.271
<i>About things you didn't tell me.</i>

00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:26.400
<i>About what happened to you</i>
<i>after I left this neighborhood.</i>

00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:30.446
<i>Why didn't you tell me anything?</i>

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.050
Miyoung!

00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:55.679
Miyoung!

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:13.072
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:16.325
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:25.250
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.922
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.719
Come out, you bastards.

00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:38.847
Come out!

00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:42.267
Come out!

00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:27.187
Okay.

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:48.333
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Seokhee. This is Byeongsoo.</i>

00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:49.710
I need your help.

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:50.919
<i>What is it?</i>

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.173
Really?

00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.759
Okay.

00:28:02.973 --> 00:28:04.808
All right, look.
When you play <i>seotda,</i>

00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:09.855
you take out the minor cards
and use these 20 cards from 1 to 10.

00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:11.690
You know one, two, three, and four, right?

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:12.774
I do.

00:28:13.984 --> 00:28:19.823
Anyway, don't doctors play cards
at occasions like funerals?

00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:22.409
Of course we do. We do it a lot.

00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:25.621
But I tend to watch others play
instead of playing cards myself.

00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:31.960
You're so nerdy.

00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:37.382
I mean, a man should know
how to play cards.

00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:40.552
Right, so I'd like to learn
some basics at least.

00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:42.137
That's a great attitude.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.388
All right, then.

00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.516
Which do you think is the strongest pair?

00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:52.606
- Pair of 10.
- Wrong.

00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:54.858
You got it wrong. It's Bright Pair.

00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:57.569
Wait, what? Bright Pair is stronger?

00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:00.364
But the chief radiologist said
Pair of 10 was stronger.

00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:04.868
Oh, rules differ a bit
depending on regions.

00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:07.537
But in the capital area,
Bright Pair is stronger.

00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:10.207
I see. So, that man plays
countryside cards.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.709
That's right.

00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:14.419
Look, these are the Bright cards.

00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:18.882
Of all, the strongest pair is
Bright Pair of three and eight.

00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:20.717
If you have this, you'll win for sure.

00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:26.807
What are you doing here?

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.266
I was asking her some questions.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.894
He says he doesn't know
how to play <i>seotda.</i>

00:29:30.978 --> 00:29:33.355
So, I'm teaching him some tips.

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:36.900
All right, the second strongest pair
is Pair of 10.

00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:39.111
Bright Pair. I better take notes.

00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:40.237
What are you talking about?

00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:43.532
Let's go. Byeongsoo's here.

00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:45.534
Byeongsoo? Why?

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:47.786
Put your shoes on.

00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:49.121
Well, then...

00:29:49.997 --> 00:29:54.042
I'd appreciate it if you could
teach me again another time.

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:55.836
Sure, Doctor. Make sure you come.

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.212
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.424
Jeez, I was having fun.

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:01.883
She's never of any help.

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.594
Gosh.

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.932
Oh, my goodness.

00:30:09.683 --> 00:30:10.809
Jeez.

00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:13.311
She sure is Seokcheol's younger sister.

00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:15.313
Is her forehead okay?

00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:17.232
She's fine, medically speaking.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.446
Is it necessary to watch the footage
to catch these scumbags?

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:24.448
I know where their gambling house is.

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:27.451
A gambling house isn't something
that stays in one place.

00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:29.870
You get the composite sketches
before investigating.

00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:32.164
I see. You're a cop after all.

00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:34.207
Here you go, sir.

00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:35.667
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:39.546
Gosh, okay.

00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:44.426
Seokhee.

00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:48.221
Call me for everything
related to Seokkyung from now on.

00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:51.099
Things got out of hand
because you called Seokcheol.

00:30:51.808 --> 00:30:53.560
Still, it's our family's business.

00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:58.398
Hey, don't be like that.
I got so much free food from your family.

00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:01.693
When Seokcheol makes a move,
it's an act of violence.

00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:04.696
When I take action,
it's realizing justice.

00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:11.203
I'll be more than grateful.

00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:15.165
But why do you suddenly want
to realize justice with our family?

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.042
Must there be a reason?

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:19.127
Seokkyung is struggling.
And I can't stand it.

00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:21.630
You're unbelievable.

00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:24.091
She might end up breaking your heart.

00:31:24.174 --> 00:31:25.717
Leave him be.

00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:27.969
He thinks your sister is
still the queen of Myoungsan.

00:31:29.096 --> 00:31:31.139
A queen never loses her class, you punk.

00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:33.558
Once a hottie, always a hottie.

00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:35.185
She's not as pretty as before.

00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:36.269
That's not true!

00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:38.438
What are you...

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.440
a plastic surgeon?

00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:41.733
You're an orthopedist.

00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:44.361
I don't have to be a plastic surgeon
to know that.

00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:46.863
Regardless of looks,
faces are the same on an X-ray scan.

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:51.910
Tell her... Gosh, sorry.

00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:55.163
Hey. Did you just look down
on orthopedists?

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.165
Dude, you're clueless.

00:31:57.249 --> 00:31:59.167
Those guys just never change.

00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:02.045
After all this time,
they're still like they were back then.

00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:30.323
- Excuse me.
- What in the...

00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:36.955
Ashtray.

00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:39.124
It's Ashtray. Hey, Ashtray!

00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:40.709
Wait!

00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:51.219
Stop there!

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.721
Dang.

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:53.805
Wait.

00:32:57.267 --> 00:32:58.268
Wait up.

00:33:08.028 --> 00:33:09.112
Gosh, I can't do this.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.575
This is killing me.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.703
Was she a track-and-field athlete?

00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:21.458
Okay.

00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:24.544
She's in this neighborhood.
That's for sure.

00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:26.213
She's dead meat.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.139
Jeez, this is bad. It's driving me nuts.

00:33:36.223 --> 00:33:38.642
How did he know I was here?

00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:39.809
Damn it.

00:33:54.324 --> 00:33:56.451
Sir, did you have lunch?

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:01.831
Hey, Bokcheon.

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:05.877
Come on, even between gangsters,
this isn't right, is it?

00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:09.464
There's nothing
I can say officially.

00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:11.925
You better answer me wisely.

00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:14.970
It sounds like you did that.

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.807
Sir, please let it slide this time.

00:34:19.975 --> 00:34:21.935
Taehoon is in the office now.

00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:23.812
I'll go and try to sort things out.

00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:26.481
As if you'll actually do that.

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.692
Sir.

00:34:28.775 --> 00:34:30.568
Where are you going?

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.905
I'm off to meet Kang Taehoon, you punk.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.407
What? But...

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:36.992
Sir!

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.243
Damn it.

00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:47.794
SAMJUN E&amp;C

00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:54.592
Hey, where do you think you're going?

00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:56.303
Where are you going?

00:34:58.346 --> 00:34:59.472
Hey, kid.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.350
You're not supposed to come in here.

00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:03.768
Boys, come out.

00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:05.895
I'm here to meet Taehoon.
He's inside, right?

00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:09.065
I'm lost for words.

00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:13.069
Since when are you
and the Chairman friends?

00:35:14.487 --> 00:35:16.448
I don't have to give you all the details.

00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:22.162
Boys.

00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:23.955
I'll take only five minutes. Must you--

00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:32.213
Hey, you.

00:35:39.095 --> 00:35:42.015
I'll break open the next one's head,
so stop, okay?

00:35:52.067 --> 00:35:55.320
Wait. Hey, stop! Stop it, you punks.

00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:56.696
Hey, Cheonho. Back off.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.781
Damn it.

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.408
Sir, please don't do this.

00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:02.869
I said I just needed five minutes.
What is this?

00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:03.953
Must I make a reservation?

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.665
Look at him.
He's about to take out a weapon.

00:36:06.748 --> 00:36:07.791
Put that back, you damn punk.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.628
- Sir, let's go out and talk.
- Seokcheol.

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.422
What are you doing there? It's noisy.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.176
Come in.

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:25.850
Damn it.

00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:31.147
Isn't it your first time
coming to my office?

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.401
My men don't recognize you
because you never come.

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:37.570
Goodness, don't look too serious.

00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:39.030
Others might think

00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:41.116
you're here to kill someone.

00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:44.994
Was it necessary
to take it this far?

00:36:45.578 --> 00:36:47.038
What are you talking about?

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:50.709
You didn't have to frame the Chairman
for doing drugs.

00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:55.296
He's old now. It'll do him good
to get a blood test done.

00:36:58.133 --> 00:37:01.010
Apologize to him,
and put an end to this here.

00:37:02.512 --> 00:37:03.930
It's not your place to say that.

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:08.601
You know how I left Changsoo's gang.

00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:13.440
I'll arrange a time

00:37:14.774 --> 00:37:17.110
for you two to talk everything out.

00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:20.405
Otherwise, this will be nothing
but a lose-lose situation for you both.

00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.452
Hey, I don't want to have
this kind of talk with you.

00:37:25.535 --> 00:37:28.163
Okay? Let's just go out
and have some soju.

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.748
What are you saying?

00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:33.877
You have to listen
to what displeases you too,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.545
not just what pleases you.

00:37:37.547 --> 00:37:38.548
Okay.

00:37:40.717 --> 00:37:41.718
Go on.

00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:46.139
Taehoon.

00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:49.934
I'm begging you.

00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.229
Please stop now.

00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:57.400
Stop?

00:38:00.737 --> 00:38:03.198
Guess what Seohyun said before she died.

00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:07.577
She said she wanted me
to be a good person.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.121
Like you.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.253
But Changsoo and Sangyeol
are stopping me from being good.

00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:18.588
What can I do?

00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:25.470
Call the Chairman.

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:28.139
Otherwise, it'll lead to a war for real.

00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:29.808
It won't end until someone dies.

00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:34.771
If Changsoo tells you

00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:38.858
to kill me, will you do it?

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:42.487
Please.

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:44.948
Must you polarize people like that?

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:51.454
Dude, that's how you survive
in this field.

00:38:52.372 --> 00:38:53.915
Good luck, then. Goodness.

00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:56.292
Seokcheol.

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.088
How did we drift apart like this?

00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.967
I don't want to be on bad terms with you.

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:08.680
I mean it.

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.185
Same here.

00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:32.912
What?

00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:34.664
Why did you go meet Kang Taehoon?

00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:37.166
I told you to find out who did it,
not meet him.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.960
I thought it'd be faster
to ask him in person.

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:41.087
So?

00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:43.214
Did he come clean
and say it was his doing?

00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:45.633
Of course not. I didn't expect him to.

00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:48.261
My point, exactly!
You shouldn't have gone there!

00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:51.681
I told him I'd arrange a time, and that
he should reach out to the Chairman.

00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:53.391
That's pointless!

00:39:53.975 --> 00:39:55.852
As if he'd reach out to the Chairman.

00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:57.395
Let's wait a bit.

00:39:57.478 --> 00:39:58.479
Gosh, that jerk.

00:39:58.563 --> 00:40:02.650
Why did you have to visit him
and ask him for a favor, you punk?

00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:04.777
He's no longer your senior!

00:40:04.861 --> 00:40:06.446
He's an enemy, punk!

00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:08.114
Right.

00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:09.616
Gosh, that damn scumbag.

00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:17.916
So, what else did he say?

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:19.500
Did he talk shit about me?

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:22.629
<i>Be careful of Sangyeol.</i>

00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:26.341
He wants to make sure
he remains Changsoo's right-hand man.

00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:28.343
Think wisely.

00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:31.679
I'm telling you to join my side
before you end up like me.

00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:34.682
They have no future.

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:40.939
Gosh, no.
It wasn't that kind of situation.

00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:42.941
- He didn't say anything.
- He didn't?

00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:44.025
That's unusual of him.

00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:49.989
What's that noise?

00:40:50.073 --> 00:40:52.367
- What the... What is it?
- What is it?

00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:55.662
Take what? Tell me.

00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:58.206
What did I take, you punk?

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.500
Do you want to die? Come here.

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.752
I'm going to kill you, damn you!

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.796
- Get off me!
- Hey!

00:41:05.672 --> 00:41:06.673
What do you think you're doing?

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:11.552
Sir, this punk shows no respect
to his senior.

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:13.012
He's much younger than me too!

00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:14.597
Act like a senior, then.

00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:15.932
- What, you punk?
- What?

00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:17.225
- Want to die?
- Hey!

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:18.643
Dusik!

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:21.020
Both of you, follow me.

00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:23.940
Gosh!

00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:36.452
Hey, you.

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:40.081
And you. What was that?

00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:43.376
Ilsu, Dusik is your senior in any case.

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:44.961
That was inappropriate, you punk.

00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:47.213
I'm sorry, sir.

00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:48.840
But I did that for a reason.

00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:52.135
Dusik takes money from his juniors
every time he drinks these days.

00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:54.012
For gambling.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.307
- What?
- If they refuse, he punishes them.

00:41:58.391 --> 00:42:00.518
Yesterday, he stole a credit card
from my wallet.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.354
Sir, the thing is...

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.357
I randomly found the credit card
and picked it up.

00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:09.110
And I didn't take money,
I only borrowed it. I'll repay them.

00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:11.446
It's true.

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:16.784
Ilsu, get out.

00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:31.049
Goodness.

00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:32.133
Jeez.

00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:46.272
The Chairman is in a holding cell,
and the gang is a mess.

00:42:46.355 --> 00:42:47.482
Goodness.

00:43:01.454 --> 00:43:03.039
What is it?

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:07.210
It's me, sir.

00:43:11.464 --> 00:43:13.508
What's the matter with you?

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:16.260
Where have you been hiding out until now?

00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:18.971
I said I was off to Gyeongju
for my dad's death anniversary.

00:43:20.223 --> 00:43:22.391
Have some bread.

00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:26.687
I know you're unhappy with Dusik
for causing too much trouble.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:30.274
This is all because of
our company's lack of benefits.

00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:32.902
What about our company's benefits,
you punk?

00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:34.112
Let's be honest.

00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:36.239
We may not have as much money
as the Taehoon Gang does,

00:43:36.322 --> 00:43:37.490
but we've got pride.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.577
But these days, you know,
since they changed their system,

00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:43.996
we've been falling behind in many ways.

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:45.832
They changed their system?

00:43:45.915 --> 00:43:48.334
They work five days a week, to begin with.

00:43:48.417 --> 00:43:51.003
Five days a week? Are you sure?

00:43:51.087 --> 00:43:55.049
Yes. Rookie gangsters these days
have a totally different attitude.

00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:57.593
They ask if we provide
any employment insurance.

00:43:57.677 --> 00:44:01.597
Anyway, you should consider offering
an incentive to strengthen our gang

00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:04.058
at a time like this.

00:44:04.142 --> 00:44:05.560
Oh, is that why?

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:07.895
You've been bad at your job
because you get no incentives?

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:09.522
I'm not bad at my job, sir.

00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:13.192
Whenever something happens,
you always go off the grid.

00:44:13.276 --> 00:44:14.277
Goodness!

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:17.155
I don't need you anymore.

00:44:17.238 --> 00:44:18.489
You can join somewhere

00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:21.033
that provides weekends off
and lots of incentives.

00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:22.869
- I apologize.
- No, I apologize.

00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:24.996
Stop coming to work
starting tomorrow, okay?

00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:27.206
And take all your stuff out of here.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.000
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Get out, you punk.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.668
Get out, I said.

00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:34.213
Enjoy the bread all you want.

00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:43.055
Goodness, every single one of them
gets on my nerves!

00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:45.516
ATTORNEY KWON

00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:51.439
Hello, sir.

00:44:57.028 --> 00:44:59.113
I said I'd take action
if you gambled again.

00:44:59.906 --> 00:45:00.907
I apologize.

00:45:03.743 --> 00:45:05.745
Your eyes don't tell me that you're sorry.

00:45:05.828 --> 00:45:07.288
They say you want to kill me.

00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:11.167
You think it's unfair that I hit you?

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.002
"Who do you think you are?" Is that it?

00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:14.879
No, sir.

00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:16.088
I'm sorry.

00:45:16.172 --> 00:45:18.549
You apologized hundreds of times already!

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:24.388
Hey, why is he sitting
in a corner looking upset?

00:45:24.472 --> 00:45:25.765
You mean, Dusik?

00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:29.644
He recently gambled away his house deposit
and went broke.

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.687
He sleeps at a sauna these days.

00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:33.814
He asked me for money, too.

00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:35.566
I mean, I have no money to lend.

00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:37.902
- Let's hurry.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:39.111
Take this.

00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:42.365
Take the money,

00:45:43.324 --> 00:45:44.408
and I'll keep this.

00:45:45.534 --> 00:45:46.535
Thank you, sir.

00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:49.330
- Dusik.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:51.040
As someone older,

00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:54.877
- let me nag you and ask you a favor.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:57.922
Quit gambling.

00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:00.466
I'm sorry, sir.

00:46:01.217 --> 00:46:02.760
Gambling doesn't suit you.

00:46:02.843 --> 00:46:04.220
You can't keep a poker face.

00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:08.099
I'll quit, sir.

00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:13.771
Get your life together.

00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:17.316
If you gamble again,
you'll never see me again.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.068
Do you get what I mean?

00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:21.570
I'm sorry.

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:28.244
Hey. Stop that and come with me.
The Chairman's being released.

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:30.079
Yes, sir.

00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:36.419
- I'm back, sir.
- Hey. When did you return?

00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:51.350
Seokkyung, what are you up to?

00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:54.562
I'm doing nothing. What's up?

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.439
Why do you sound so down?

00:46:56.522 --> 00:46:58.399
- Did you skip a meal?
<i>- I have no appetite.</i>

00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:00.901
I just feel empty.

00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:03.195
Why? Do you miss Hyeonggeun?

00:47:03.904 --> 00:47:05.406
<i>Still, you should eat something.</i>

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:07.158
What's the use of eating

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:09.243
when my heart is empty?

00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:12.455
- Why don't you have some donuts with me?
<i>- Donuts?</i>

00:47:12.538 --> 00:47:14.915
I'm here to meet you.

00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:16.334
<i>- I'm coming up.</i>
- Wait.

00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:18.586
Wait. You're down there?

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:19.754
<i>Meet me for a bit.</i>

00:47:20.296 --> 00:47:21.589
Hold on. Wait.

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.341
Don't come up, wait.

00:47:23.424 --> 00:47:26.594
Come up when I tell you to, okay?

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:28.679
Seokkyung, why--

00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:33.142
So cute.

00:47:33.934 --> 00:47:35.102
Goodness, why donuts?

00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:37.313
Donuts will only make me fat.

00:47:38.189 --> 00:47:39.273
Jeez.

00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:43.652
She doesn't have
to doll herself up, though.

00:47:43.736 --> 00:47:45.529
Have you seen this woman
in the area?

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:47.990
No.

00:47:48.074 --> 00:47:49.283
Then, go.

00:47:53.412 --> 00:47:55.706
Gosh, okay.

00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:09.887
Excuse me.
Have you seen this woman around?

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.433
- Gosh, she's pretty.
- No way.

00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:16.435
Does she look pretty only to me?

00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:18.437
I've seen her many times. I know her well.

00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:19.688
- Really?
- Yes.

00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:22.191
Then, do you know where she lives?

00:48:22.274 --> 00:48:24.693
Of course I do.
Get in. I'll drive you there.

00:48:24.777 --> 00:48:25.945
You'll give me a ride? Thanks.

00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:28.197
- Can you send me that photo?
- Sure.

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:33.285
Look, I think you're mistaken.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:36.789
You really are mistaken.

00:48:36.872 --> 00:48:38.707
She's a close friend of mine.

00:48:38.791 --> 00:48:40.668
I'm just wondering how she's doing.

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:42.795
- Is she doing well?
- Is she pretty or not?

00:48:43.504 --> 00:48:44.755
She's beautiful, I think.

00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:46.382
Good boy.

00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:49.009
Now, follow your conscience and brain

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:52.555
to answer my questions
at the count of two.

00:48:52.638 --> 00:48:54.098
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:57.768
- Where is your gambling house?
- A green house?

00:48:57.852 --> 00:48:59.645
One. Two.

00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:07.653
What the...

00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:10.906
<i>Sorry, Seokkyung.</i>
<i>I suddenly have to go somewhere.</i>

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.075
<i>I'll visit you again with a gift.</i>

00:49:13.159 --> 00:49:14.368
What's with this guy?

00:49:22.418 --> 00:49:24.712
What was I doing?

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:25.796
Goodness.

00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:31.343
- Stay still. You're distracting me.
- Yes, sir.

00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:34.597
Goodness gracious.

00:49:42.104 --> 00:49:44.607
MYOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:48.235
Oh.

00:49:49.445 --> 00:49:50.446
I'm sorry for your trouble, sir.

00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:53.407
Mr. Chairman.

00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:08.464
Did you find out who framed me...

00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:11.675
for being a junkie?

00:50:13.552 --> 00:50:16.263
Kang Taehoon, that rat,
is behind it for sure.

00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:18.891
But we don't have concrete evidence.

00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:21.519
Yes, we do.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.606
Kang Taehoon himself is concrete evidence.

00:50:26.565 --> 00:50:28.651
How should I take him down?

00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:37.159
Damn you.

00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:04.603
Are you okay?

00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:06.772
Excuse me.

00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:14.405
Are you okay?

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.130
You lowered your guard.

00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:34.091
If you lower your guard,

00:51:34.842 --> 00:51:35.926
you're bound to lose.

00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:47.896
You came.

00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:56.322
This is because of
that damn Ashtray.

00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:58.907
- Did you find her?
- No.

00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:00.618
Where's Halibut?

00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:02.745
I'll try calling him.

00:52:02.828 --> 00:52:04.413
Gosh, this is so annoying.

00:52:06.707 --> 00:52:09.001
Please let go of me...

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:11.629
Hello.

00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:14.715
What an outfit.

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.759
He's like that man
in the Rainy Bright card.

00:52:16.842 --> 00:52:19.094
Hey, who are you?

00:52:19.178 --> 00:52:20.721
Seokkyung's cousin?

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:24.266
Is her entire family
a bunch of thugs?

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:25.351
I am...

00:52:27.686 --> 00:52:28.937
What about that?

00:52:30.272 --> 00:52:31.273
Are you farsighted?

00:52:33.108 --> 00:52:34.109
I'm a cop.

00:52:35.444 --> 00:52:36.737
It's nice to see you.

00:52:37.446 --> 00:52:38.989
You can consult an attorney.

00:52:39.073 --> 00:52:40.407
Detective!

00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:42.493
Please don't do this.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.996
I'm doing all this for love.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.331
Love, you know it, right?

00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:52.795
I do. But I don't have to be arrested
because of love, do I?

00:52:56.924 --> 00:52:57.925
You think?

00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:01.011
Then,

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:04.807
should I give you a chance
out of the goodness of my heart?

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:06.100
Yes!

00:53:07.559 --> 00:53:08.560
Okay.

00:53:09.186 --> 00:53:10.938
Don't ever try
to contact Park Seokkyung again.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.733
The 30 million won she owes you?
Consider it bad luck and forget about it.

00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:16.610
Okay.

00:53:16.694 --> 00:53:21.156
And if Seokkyung ever happens to see
any of the jerks here,

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.492
feels like she's seen them,
or expects to see them,

00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:25.077
you'll be arrested.

00:53:25.536 --> 00:53:26.537
Okay.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.748
- If she gambles again, you'll be arrested.
- Okay.

00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:32.501
If she hurts her leg on the street,
catches a cold,

00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:35.421
or suffers from a broken heart,
you'll be arrested. Do you understand?

00:53:36.422 --> 00:53:37.423
Yes!

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.758
You guys, answer him.

00:53:39.842 --> 00:53:40.843
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:43.137
That's nice and clear.
Let's clean it all up!

00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:47.516
Please uncuff me.

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:50.728
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:53.105
Welcome back, sir!

00:53:58.485 --> 00:53:59.486
Ah, Seokcheol.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.989
Tell the boys to buy some tofu...
Never mind.

00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:04.658
- You know his favorite sushi place, right?
- Yes.

00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:06.827
Go get some, and two bottles of cold beer.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.036
Wait here for a bit.

00:54:10.748 --> 00:54:11.999
Gosh.

00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:26.346
How is the prep going?

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:28.599
Almost all the tables are taken.

00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:30.309
You're so popular already!

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:35.189
By any chance,
did you save the table I asked for?

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:37.649
Who is it for that you care so much?
Your boyfriend?

00:54:38.442 --> 00:54:40.110
That man from the other day?

00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:49.536
Over there, that is for your guest.

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.456
It's a VIP table,
and I've saved it.

00:55:09.264 --> 00:55:13.060
<i>Sorry, I might be</i>
<i>a bit late today. Good luck.</i>

00:55:19.942 --> 00:55:20.943
SORRY, I MIGHT BE A BIT LATE TODAY.
GOOD LUCK.

00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:23.570
Coming.

00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:51.348
<i>The number you've dialed</i>
<i>is not available. Please leave--</i>

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.017
Try again.

00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:57.229
I might have to try it sometime later.
He wouldn't--

00:55:57.312 --> 00:55:58.605
Keep trying, you idiot!

00:56:07.072 --> 00:56:10.242
When we can't reach OSEON,
there has to be a reason.

00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:11.660
So, try it again.

00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:13.662
Yes, sir.

00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:21.920
<i>The number you've dialed is not available.</i>

00:56:24.339 --> 00:56:25.340
What is it?

00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:28.802
It's a text message from OSEON.

00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:31.805
- What does it say?
- That they won't work with us.

00:56:32.556 --> 00:56:34.224
Rumors have spread
because of the drug issue.

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:36.643
They say it's too risky.

00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:46.320
HWANG OF OSEON
SORRY, WE CAN'T WORK WITH YOU

00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:54.661
So, this was what Kang Taehoon was after.

00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:00.584
Mr. Chairman.

00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:05.964
Should we set something up
to sucker-punch them too?

00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:07.966
No.

00:57:08.884 --> 00:57:10.344
That's not how it should be done.

00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:15.432
One of us has to be gone once and for all

00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:17.476
for this to end.

00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:24.733
Is Seokcheol outside?

00:57:29.363 --> 00:57:30.614
Mop the floor.

00:57:31.406 --> 00:57:33.200
Keep things clean already. Tsk!

00:57:33.909 --> 00:57:35.035
Goodness.

00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:46.880
SORRY, I MIGHT BE A BIT LATE TODAY.
GOOD LUCK.

00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:49.758
Is she busy?

00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:51.593
Seokcheol.

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.387
Yes, sir.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.972
Come inside.
The Chairman wants to talk to you.

00:58:05.524 --> 00:58:06.525
Cheonho.

00:58:07.275 --> 00:58:09.986
Given his temper,
Kim Changsoo will attack us for sure.

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:13.031
Tell Jaebong to prep our men,
and keep them ready.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.991
Yes, sir.

00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:16.451
We might be late. Let's hurry.

quietly by yourself.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.592

<i>Her boyfriend</i>

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.188
Give it to me.
What are you doing?

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:14.272
Let go of me!

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.526
<i>Park Seokcheol.</i>
<i>Why does it have to be you?</i>

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.320
<i>This complicates things.</i>

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.530
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:23.865
