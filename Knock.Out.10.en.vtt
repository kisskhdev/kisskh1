00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.040
Shall we take them now, boss?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.280
You're Sia Tep?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.080
Why’d you kill my dad?!

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.600
Hey!
Keen!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.080
You killed my dad.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400
Why’d you kill my dad?!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.560
Your dad, Kanchit, stole my money!

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.120
Pakorn and I have prepared everything.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.880
So for today’s first match, I’m putting Thun in the ring.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.680
Are you sure everything will be okay?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.520
Hey, Yut’s using a weapon!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Thun!

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640
Thun!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.000
Thun! You asshole!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.720
Thun!

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.320
Safe House

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.680
(Ten minutes earlier)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.560
Alright, everyone, listen to me carefully.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.600
Pakorn and I have prepared everything.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
You don’t need to worry.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.680
First, we need to make this place as chaotic as possible

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.720
to create a distraction.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.440
to create a distraction.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.880
Everyone, run!
Quickly!

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.680
Run, everyone!
Run! Hurry!

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520
Run! Hurry!

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.840
Then I’ll be the one to hit the switch to help Thun and Keen escape.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.040
As for you two..

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.640
Hey!

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.440
Our plan is to draw their attention away.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.760
We’ve got intruders inside! Get in here and help!

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.640
Go, hurry!

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.880
This way!

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920
Damn, the door’s locked!

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.600
Dad, Let me try.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.840
You check the back door.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.760
You two come with me to the front, quick!

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.160
Hey, guard this door.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.640
Got it.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.680
Hurry up!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.960
Hey!

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.080
I told you, didn’t I?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.040
You’ll never escape me.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.760
Is this all you’ve got?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.680
Pathetic.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
You love him that much, huh?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.760
Huh?!

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.240
You really love him?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.600
Good!

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.840
Then I’ll take everything that’s yours and make it mine.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.000
What’s wrong with me?

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.960
You want to know what the fuck is wrong with me?

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.680
It’s because of you!

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.640
I have to be like this.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.280
Pakorn loves you.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.160
Pakorn helps you.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.520
And the one who had to suffer for it was me!

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.720
And now you still have the nerve to ask me that?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.480
Are you ready to play with me, darling?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.960
I won’t let you lay a finger on Keen.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.520
What should we do?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.840
Hey, how are you guys?

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.600
Barely made it. What about the others?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.720
Right?

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.600
Yeah, what about Typhoon?

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.240
Exactly.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.120
What about Thun and Keen?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.240
I haven’t seen them.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.880
What do we do now?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.440
Shit.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.720
They’re here!
Hey, they’re here!

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.120
Thun! Keen!

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.160
How are you guys?

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.000
We’re okay.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.880
But the door’s locked, what now?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.880
What do we do?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.400
Bung!

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.680
What are you doing, Mai?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.840
What are you doing?!

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.280
Got it!

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.400
Hey, how’d you do that?

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.480
I saw it online, bro.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.280
Here’s the key!

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.680
Go! Get out, quick!

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.240
Hey!
Get out!

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.280
Hurry!

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.720
Move!

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.720
Hey!

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.200
Coach!
Dad!

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.040
Dad!

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.320
Hey, Dad!

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.080
Open the door!

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.280
You need to run.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.480
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.160
Go.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.840
Dad, open the door!
Hey!

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.760
Don’t you dare hurt my dad!

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.680
Hey, bro!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.800
Don’t you dare hurt my dad!

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.880
Hey, bro!

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.720
Bro!

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.520
Pakorn and Typhoon are still inside!

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.160
Stop.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.200
Dad!

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.040
Get out of the way

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.800
Let's go.
Just go!

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.040
Go now!

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.320
Think you’re so tough, huh?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.960
Calm down first.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.560
Die!

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.760
Hey!

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720
I'll take care of it.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.200
Are you sure you want to go in there?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.600
Yeah.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.040
You’re all look like a mess.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.240
Hey, who’s that lady over there?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.320
Shhh, quiet.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.280
Go clean yourself first, then we’ll talk.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Thank you.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.160
Whoa, how’d you do that?

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.520
I'll try too.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.520
I can’t do it.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.920
You have to blow gently.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.960
I did it!

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.360
Ow!

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.200
Sorry.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.880
It's the internal wound from a blow.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.480
At least you're still alive.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.800
Ait…

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:49.240
Do you know that Dad always does everything for me?

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.280
I want to do something for him too.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.800
I want to make him proud for once.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.320
Hey..

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.240
Please stay calm, okay?

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:03.720
Like Keen said, Pakorn and Typhoon are still inside.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.160
At least we should trust them, right?

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.040
Stay calm.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.320
We’ll get through this together.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.800
So you've been like this since you were a kid?

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.680
Yeah.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.000
Why?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.600
No reason, I won’t judge.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.560
Hey!

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.800
Hey!

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.840
What is it? Let me see.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.760
No.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.080
Come on, let me see!

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.000
No.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.960
Why are you getting shy?

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.200
Let me see, come on.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.440
Nope.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.680
I wasn’t handsome back then.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.640
Alright.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.840
Just don’t make fun of me.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.240
Why are you laughing?

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.800
It’s kinda cute.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.480
You were a crybaby too, weren’t you?

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.240
Well, boxing hurts, okay?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.200
But you’ve come this far, well, what a good boy.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.120
Oh, so now you're messing with my head, huh?

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.040
Hey!

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.960
Now you're messing with my head?
Stop!

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.960
Stop!

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.520
Stop!

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.320
Let go.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320
No!

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.640
Let go.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.480
No!

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.480
Ow!

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.200
Ait, I have a surprise for you.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.200
What?

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.800
Kaew!

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.320
Kaew, are you safe?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.960
I’m fine. What about you?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.600
Yeah, I’m fine.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.160
Look at me, I’m strong as ever.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.920
Let go!

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.520
Ow!

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.600
Hey, Kaew.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:29.800
Don’t forget to take your meds, water and eat well, okay?

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.440
So we can meet again soon.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.200
Okay.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.840
Ait, are you crying?

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.400
Why are you crying?

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.600
I’m not crying!

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.720
Mawin, please take care of my brother, okay?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.000
Of course, Kaew. I’ll take great care of him.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.720
Don’t you say.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.600
I’m the one who should be taking care of you.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.520
But how did you end up there, Kaew?

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.520
P’Klao came to pick me up.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.960
Hello?

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.440
Hi.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.880
Say thanks to Pakorn and Thun, not me.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.480
I’m really grateful to you.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.640
Go thank Pakorn and Thun!

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.600
(Klao, right? I've beem waiting.)

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.280
Hey, you again…

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.160
We meet again, Klao.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.160
What’s going on here?

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.520
I’ve got something I’d like your help with.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.800
Let me hang up first.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.320
I've got to get Kaew’s meds ready.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:03.960
Okay.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.040
Let’s go.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.720
Bye, Ait. Bye, Mawin.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.600
Bye, Kaew.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.760
Bye-bye!

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.680
Get plenty of rest.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.680
Wait, P’Klao!

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.280
You hung up?

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.120
If I’d known, I wouldn’t have let you talk to her.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.280
I didn’t even get to talk to Klao.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.360
You guys, seriously…

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:41.880
If it weren’t for your dad, who knows what could’ve happened to Klao and Kaew.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.880
So what do we do next?

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.080
Honestly, I'm still not sure.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.320
All we know is that we have to help Uncle Petch.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.280
If I’d just listened to Mom from the beginning,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.800
none of this would’ve happened.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.520
What do you mean?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.560
She told me to quit boxing.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.720
If I hadn’t been a boxer, none of this might’ve happened.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.360
It’s not because you were a boxer.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.880
Don’t blame boxing.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.440
Of course it was.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.360
You probably think I'm old-fashioned

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.480
always trying to hold you back.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.720
But think about it,

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.000
what kind of mother wants to see her child getting hurt?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.520
I could give you everything,

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.240
and yet, you still insisted on boxing.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.440
But…

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.080
If you hated boxing so much,

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.320
why did you marry Dad?

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.920
You and Dad were different.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.480
He had no other choice.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.600
I loved him because he fought for everything.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.400
He did everything for the people he loved.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:09.120
We struggled together until your grandparents finally agreed to let us marry.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.600
And he promised me he’d quit boxing.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:32.480
But one day, he left me and you to go work with those people.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.280
I always thought something was off.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.680
Turns out, I was right.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.240
Just look at the two of you now.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.680
Let’s not dwell on the pain of the past.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.080
What matters most now is your happiness.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.080
Do you understand?

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.440
You’re just like your father,

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.720
get scolded a little and you act all mopey.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.800
Thun, go help Mom in the kitchen.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.080
Hurry up.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.200
Smells amazing, Bung.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.280
Take it easy.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.640
Thank you so much.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.240
We haven’t eaten anything since this morning.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.800
Thank you, Mom.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.600
Thanks!

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.800
Here you go.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.760
Thanks.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.800
Mai,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.960
I’m not eating this. You want it?

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.920
Sure.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.080
Extra.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.600
Thank you.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.920
Thanks.
Thank you.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.640
Eat up. You need strength.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.840
Yeah.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.520
So, how long have you two been together?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.160
For a little while now, Mom.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.280
You guys are official?

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.880
What, you didn’t know?

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.920
You knew too?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.960
Everyone at the gym knows.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.120
Just eat already.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.480
And no need to do the dishes after,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.400
I’ll have the maid take care of it.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.400
No, it’s okay. I feel bad, I’ll help clean up.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.520
No need.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.080
I’m just worried you’ll break something

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.960
these dishes are expensive.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.840
So when did you guys start dating?

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.480
Why didn’t I know anything about this?

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.720
Jeez, Mai, why are you so curious?

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.000
What? It’s just about being a couple.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.280
Why all the secrecy?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.880
Actually, Mai’s got a point.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.480
You and Ait are flirty and never had to hide.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.480
Eat up.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.240
Eat a lot, I don’t want you to be hungry.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.600
Aw, how thoughtful. Thanks.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.400
I just don’t want you to be hungry.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.240
I’ll stop talking now.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.360
Wow, we’re about to have some real drama.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.200
Wanna try me?

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.880
No, it’s okay. The porridge is already great.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.960
Everyone..

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.760
Calm down.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.040
Pick it up, Keen.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.160
(MP Phuwit)

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.160
Keen.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.320
Gotta hand it to you.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.640
You did great leading everyone to escape.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.600
I really underestimated you.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:21.680
But unlucky for you, your Coach Petch didn’t get away.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.040
What did you do to Uncle Petch?

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.680
Don’t you dare hurt him!

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.160
What do you want from us?

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.560
Relax, your Coach Petch is safe.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.560
But you already know what I want.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.240
Give me the code.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:43.840
Otherwise, he’ll end up just like your father, Kanchit.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.040
Die the same way.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.360
Keen, don’t believe him!

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.600
He’s going to kill Uncle Petch anyway.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.440
Dad…

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.040
Dad…

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.600
Don’t you dare hurt my dad!

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.880
Calm down.
Don’t touch my dad!

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.800
Calm down.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.800
Calm down.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.840
You.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.800
Calm down.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.880
Calm down.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.040
This won’t help anything.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.960
Calm down.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.920
Calm down.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.760
Don’t you dare touch Uncle Petch.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:25.160
If you lay a finger on him, don’t expect me to give you that code.

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.880
If anything happens to him.. even a scratch..

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.120
I’ll destroy the code.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.880
You know what kind of person I am.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.960
Ha!

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.160
Nice try, Keen. You think you can fool me?

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:49.120
If you had the code from the start, none of this would’ve…

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.520
Twenty-four words.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.400
The code is a 24 English words, right?

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.400
What?

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.760
Yeah.. back then, I didn’t have it.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
But now I do.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.160
Jonathan

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.240
Give Uncle Petch back,

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.600
and I’ll give you the code.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800
Where?

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.600
Somewhere crowded.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.680
Then let’s do it at my Heaven’s Arena match this Friday.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.880
Come quickly, and be on time.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.600
My Jonathan is very hungry.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.120
You’re lucky, Coach Petch.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.080
Keen, you have the code?

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.040
Nope.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.400
Then why the hell did you agree to give it to him?

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.600
What if we can’t find it in time?

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.000
Or do you want to see your dad get hurt?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.960
Bro…

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.280
Calm down.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.440
Calm down.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.760
Maybe Keen already has a plan.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.600
Right now, this really is our best shot.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.360
Keen, what exactly is the code?

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.600
It’s a wallet.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.960
The code is supposed to be 24 random words.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.160
But why does that bastard want the code so bad?

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.200
Because…

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.680
The money in the wallet…

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.920
It’s the money my dad stole from him.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.080
I’m sorry.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.840
I only just found out myself.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.480
So all of this is because of you?

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.320
Take it easy.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.080
Hey.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.720
But everyone here’s a victim of that bastard too.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.360
Mawin

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.120
It’s okay, I’ll check on him.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.560
Keen,

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.200
where did your dad hide the code?

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.760
We’ll help look for it together.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760
Uh…

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.320
I still have no idea.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.160
Then why did you promise him?

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.800
What if you can’t find it?

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.880
Keen…

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.760
Thun, just go back.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.120
You can leave me here.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.200
Where’d you get this?

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.920
When I was little and throwing tantrums,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.880
Mom used to bring out these sparkler sticks to calm me down.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.680
It’d ease my mind for a moment.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.160
So whenever I feel bad,

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.760
I light a sparkler.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.960
I think it might help you too.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.560
That’s very sweet. Thanks.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.400
I know how you feel.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.840
In the past,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.040
I didn’t want anyone to see me

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.600
during the weakest time.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.160
I just didn’t want you to see me like this.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.400
I’m afraid you’d feel bad too.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.520
But now we have each other, Keen.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.840
No matter what happens,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.440
I’ll always be by your side.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.880
Looks like it’s going to rain.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.960
Come on, I want to take you somewhere.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.160
Where are we going?

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.200
Where are you taking me, Thun?

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.200
Come on.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.560
It’s dark.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.080
Wait a sec…

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:34.600
Hey, this is the same place from the photo in your room!

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.480
Yeah.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.280
Watch this.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.600
Whoa, how’d you do that?

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.280
Here, try it.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.320
Thanks.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.360
Yum.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.120
It’s raining, let’s head back.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.000
You’ve been practicing this since you were a kid?

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:27.160
Yeah. Took years to get it right.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.520
Why is there a mattress here?

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:47.640
Back then, when Mom and Dad had a fight,

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.520
I’d sneak out and sleep here.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:02.080
Ah… like your safe zone?

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.160
It’s sweet. Wanna try?

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.440
Mmm… it is very sweet.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.960
At least something good happened today.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.400
Who knows what tomorrow holds.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.520
Let it be tomorrow’s problem.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.760
Keen.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.000
Thun.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
That wasn’t so hard.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.920
There’s no puzzle we can’t solve.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.960
Sometimes the answer we’re looking for is easier than we think.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.080
If we just open our hearts.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.640
Thun…

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.560
Wake up.

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.160
What is it, Keen?

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.160
I know where we need to go.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.720
Then I’ll give you a chance to prove yourself.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.240
Bring Thun, Keen, and the code.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.120
Are you sure about going there?

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.560
If it were Dad, he’d definitely hide the code there.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.840
There’s no puzzle we can’t solve.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.840
Sometimes the answer is simpler than we think.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:37.560
Everyone around me has a reason to betray me.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.920
No matter where we go, we go together.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.920
Keen, watch out.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.400
You're the only person I have left.
