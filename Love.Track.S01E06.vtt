00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:15.451

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:29.668
(Kim Sun Young, Kim Dan)

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:32.504
(Oh Woo Ri, Kim Hak Sun)

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:40.211
This is actually good news.

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:42.180
I guess I was lucky.

00:00:42.714 --> 00:00:43.515
Right?

00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:50.255
They caught it early.
They said it's treatable.

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.825
Just don't tell Min Woo yet.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.096
It's his final semester,
and he's really busy right now.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.766
And he's even in Seoul.
What if he comes all the way here?

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.134
Even if it's stage one,

00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:05.937
this isn't a cold. It's lung cancer.

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:08.139
You can't just hide something like that.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:10.842
Well,

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:14.713
he said he can't come home for a while...

00:01:14.713 --> 00:01:16.281
because he's busy with his thesis
and job hunting.

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:18.717
So if we can hide it, then we hide it.

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:20.585
Okay?

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:36.468
Should I skip the alumni meeting?
I feel bad.

00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:39.971
You already packed everything.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.807
Then for the kimchi-making,

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:45.610
I'll come tomorrow,
and we'll do it together.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.312
No, it's fine. If we don't do it today,

00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:49.280
you won't even have kimchi
to eat tomorrow.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.216
Skipping it for one day won't kill me.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:52.117
Really?

00:01:53.084 --> 00:01:55.387
You, who can't take a single bite
without homemade kimchi?

00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:58.156
Then I'm really not doing it.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:01:59.357
You're the one who said it's fine.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.161
Should I really not tell Min Woo?

00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:06.965
Later, I'll tell him myself.

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:07.866
You can go.

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:22.113
Please wait for me.

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:24.783
Thank you.

00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:27.185
Mom.

00:02:28.953 --> 00:02:31.222
How did you get here?

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:32.257
Get in, quick.

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.903
Mom, should I take all this
into the kitchen?

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:48.139
Yeah. I'll head out in a minute.

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:54.446
- Just put it there.
- Okay.

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:57.082
Or should I put it out on the balcony?

00:02:57.682 --> 00:03:00.285
Why wait to do it with Dad tomorrow?
Let's just do it now, with me.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.655
And how about kimchi and boiled pork...

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:06.725
with soju for dinner today?

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:07.859
Soju, all of a sudden?

00:03:08.827 --> 00:03:11.196
Fine, let's make kimchi.
But you're the only one drinking.

00:03:11.196 --> 00:03:12.664
I'm on a diet.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.836
Let's see how that diet holds up
in front of kimchi and boiled pork.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:42.327
Anything I can help with?

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:43.194
This.

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:45.463
- Try it.
- Okay.

00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:52.704
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.179
(Kimchi)

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:04.582
Done.

00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:14.626
You really won't eat it?

00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:17.429
That's not like you.

00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:20.298
You don't know me.

00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:23.802
And you, drunk like this,
don't feel like my son either.

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:27.806
You don't know me either, Mom.

00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:31.409
How could I not know
the son I gave birth to in pain?

00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:36.681
Looking at you,

00:04:37.182 --> 00:04:38.883
I can see
you've been worrying a lot lately...

00:04:39.818 --> 00:04:41.953
about job hunting.

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:46.057
So much that you came all the way home...

00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:47.892
without saying a word.

00:04:50.328 --> 00:04:51.429
Don't put yourself down.

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:56.034
You know you've been my pride
my whole life, right?

00:04:57.235 --> 00:05:00.638
Not because you achieved something
or became someone.

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:04.643
- Just you, as you are...
- Makes you proud?

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:08.346
That's right.

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:10.015
If you need anything, just say the word.

00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:15.487
Then, Mom.

00:05:15.487 --> 00:05:16.287
Yeah?

00:05:18.923 --> 00:05:20.892
Can you lend me 1,000 dollars?

00:05:22.727 --> 00:05:25.964
My English scores just won't go up,
so I looked into an academy,

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:29.401
and the tuition is 1,000 dollars.

00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:34.372
You didn't come all this way
just for that, did you?

00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:39.144
You're busy. You could've just called.

00:05:39.878 --> 00:05:41.613
If you told Dad, that would me...

00:05:41.613 --> 00:05:43.214
Is there more soju?

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:45.583
You want to drink more?

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:46.418
Yeah.

00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:49.154
I want more.

00:05:52.357 --> 00:05:54.592
(Husband)

00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:56.995
Min Woo will be here tomorrow,

00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:59.230
so be careful what you say
about my illness.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.466
I made kimchi with Min Woo,
so don't worry.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.169
It turned out really well.

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:41.873
(Start aptitude test problem-solving)

00:06:53.652 --> 00:06:54.786
(Kang Sae Ra)

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.894
So what about the 1,000 dollars?

00:07:03.628 --> 00:07:04.696
Did you manage to get it?

00:07:06.965 --> 00:07:09.267
Did you get the money to give
that bastard who's blackmailing you?

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:11.269
Hello?

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.571
Did you say blackmail?

00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:32.691
(Please enter your fingerprint or PIN.)

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:56.815
I can finally get through.

00:07:57.482 --> 00:08:00.018
I've been waiting for you to answer.

00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:01.353
I'm...

00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:04.990
trying to make sense of this,
so let me ask clearly.

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:07.359
My Min Woo...

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.462
came home...

00:08:11.463 --> 00:08:13.898
and asked for 1,000 dollars for tuition...

00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:17.569
because of...

00:08:18.703 --> 00:08:21.039
someone's blackmail?

00:08:21.473 --> 00:08:24.809
Talk to Min Woo directly when he wakes up.

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:26.211
I'm sorry.

00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:29.147
If he doesn't send the money
or report it to the police,

00:08:30.348 --> 00:08:31.282
they're going to...

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:35.787
expose that my son, Min Woo,

00:08:39.357 --> 00:08:42.761
is "that?"

00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:45.363
To his family, school, everything?

00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:58.343
That's ridiculous.

00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.879
That's not true.

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:02.013
Excuse me?

00:09:03.148 --> 00:09:04.649
That's not true.

00:09:05.283 --> 00:09:07.519
I can't even.

00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:11.089
Didn't you see the photo
in the blackmail message?

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.224
I said it's not true.

00:09:13.224 --> 00:09:15.226
Do you think I don't know my own son?

00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:17.195
I'm his mother.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.065
Then who are you?

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:21.566
Who are you?

00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:24.002
Who do you think you are,
acting like you know Min Woo so well?

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:26.671
Just a friend.

00:10:01.272 --> 00:10:02.874
What are you doing, Mom? Drinking?

00:10:06.611 --> 00:10:08.780
You said you weren't going to drink.

00:10:10.482 --> 00:10:12.651
I sent 1,000 dollars to your account.

00:10:15.387 --> 00:10:17.022
What? Is Dad home?

00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:21.393
No.

00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:24.796
I'm not telling your dad.

00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:26.631
- There's nothing to tell.
- What?

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:31.636
When I remarried,
and we lived in that tiny room,

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.172
how old were you back then?

00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:36.841
About ten, right?

00:10:40.378 --> 00:10:43.481
You must be pretty drunk
since you're talking about the old days.

00:10:43.481 --> 00:10:46.318
Do you remember what I used to tell you...

00:10:47.552 --> 00:10:49.421
all the time back then?

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:53.158
"Always remember this."

00:10:53.758 --> 00:10:55.226
"For both you and me."

00:10:56.961 --> 00:10:58.897
"In front of your stepfather
and grandmother."

00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:01.766
I said once is a mistake,

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:05.437
but twice is a failure.

00:11:09.474 --> 00:11:11.710
What are you trying to say?

00:11:19.017 --> 00:11:21.586
You made a mistake, just once.

00:11:22.253 --> 00:11:23.154
Right?

00:11:27.525 --> 00:11:29.227
One thousand dollars is cheap.

00:11:29.995 --> 00:11:31.796
If anything, we were lucky,

00:11:32.964 --> 00:11:34.532
because you caught it early.

00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:38.870
But Mom, this is...

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.272
If you learned something from this,

00:11:42.574 --> 00:11:43.942
that's enough.

00:11:45.477 --> 00:11:46.811
Failure is not an option.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.655
But this...

00:11:59.391 --> 00:12:01.626
isn't a mistake,
and blackmailing is a crime.

00:12:03.595 --> 00:12:04.996
I was blackmailed.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.365
So you're saying that that's true?

00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:11.636
No. It's a mistake.

00:12:15.674 --> 00:12:16.675
Mom,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.578
you're angry at me right now, aren't you?

00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:24.382
Not at the blackmailer, but at me.

00:12:29.387 --> 00:12:30.322
When...

00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:35.126
I was blackmailed, I was scared.

00:12:35.393 --> 00:12:37.028
I was scared you'd react like this, Mom.

00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:39.164
Get a grip, Min Woo.

00:12:40.065 --> 00:12:42.534
You just pay the money and end it.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.318
You can't do this to me, Min Woo.

00:13:02.253 --> 00:13:03.388
I have cancer.

00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:04.856
Lung cancer.

00:13:07.926 --> 00:13:09.861
The doctor strictly forbade alcohol.

00:13:11.663 --> 00:13:12.697
But I drank...

00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:15.533
because of you.

00:13:20.472 --> 00:13:21.439
Go to bed.

00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:47.999
I'll take the first train back to Seoul.

00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:49.868
I'm sorry.

00:13:50.902 --> 00:13:52.570
And the 1,000 dollars.

00:13:53.672 --> 00:13:54.639
Thank you.

00:14:09.954 --> 00:14:11.222
The day after you left,

00:14:11.923 --> 00:14:14.092
I threw up in the middle of a meal.

00:14:18.363 --> 00:14:22.133
As you can see,
the tumor was completely removed.

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:23.568
My throat gets hoarse often.

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:27.605
When I cough, phlegm keeps coming up.

00:14:32.644 --> 00:14:34.879
But I'm fine.

00:14:35.246 --> 00:14:36.381
I really am.

00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:38.016
You know why?

00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:40.618
No matter how serious cancer is,

00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:42.988
if you treat it, it gets better.

00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:45.557
You can overcome it.

00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:49.828
If even cancer can be cured,

00:14:50.228 --> 00:14:51.596
then you can also cure "that."

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.402
I love you very much, son.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.537
You know that, right?

00:15:11.182 --> 00:15:14.119
But are you really that busy?

00:15:14.986 --> 00:15:17.288
Why haven't you contacted me for days?

00:15:17.822 --> 00:15:18.923
(3 weeks later)

00:15:18.923 --> 00:15:23.361
I thought I'd bring it myself
and see his face while I'm at it.

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:27.365
Honey, I'm here. I'll hang up now.

00:15:47.485 --> 00:15:48.486
Min Woo.

00:15:49.854 --> 00:15:50.855
Min Woo.

00:16:03.134 --> 00:16:05.236
My goodness.

00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:07.005
I'm so sorry.

00:16:08.807 --> 00:16:11.509
I just brought some kimchi.

00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:14.846
I truly had no idea...

00:16:15.146 --> 00:16:16.915
that Min Woo had a girlfriend.

00:16:18.984 --> 00:16:23.054
I mean,
he hasn't been in touch at all lately.

00:16:25.323 --> 00:16:27.092
But I worried for nothing.

00:16:28.693 --> 00:16:30.161
A girlfriend? That makes no sense.

00:16:31.563 --> 00:16:33.198
If you're not his girlfriend, who are you?

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:39.704
These days, do friends also...

00:16:42.007 --> 00:16:43.308
Don't you remember me?

00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:46.845
- You?
- We spoke on the phone last time.

00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:51.650
I'm Kang Sae Ra.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.951
We talked about the 1,000 dollars
last time.

00:16:58.023 --> 00:16:58.857
I see.

00:17:01.526 --> 00:17:02.494
Okay.

00:17:06.698 --> 00:17:09.901
Do you know where Min Woo is right now?

00:17:10.402 --> 00:17:12.637
Why isn't he answering his phone?

00:17:13.972 --> 00:17:15.140
He disappeared.

00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:18.610
It's been about two weeks now.

00:17:28.453 --> 00:17:29.287
That day,

00:17:30.422 --> 00:17:32.657
Min Woo sent the 1,000 dollars.

00:17:34.092 --> 00:17:36.628
The guy who appeared in the photo
with him was blackmailed too,

00:17:37.762 --> 00:17:39.397
but he didn't send the money.

00:17:39.964 --> 00:17:40.932
And then,

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:45.270
the photos were actually sent
to his family and everyone around him.

00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:47.972
And a few days later,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.541
he died.

00:17:57.015 --> 00:17:59.718
In those photos that were sent,

00:17:59.718 --> 00:18:01.486
did my kid's face show up too?

00:18:02.187 --> 00:18:03.321
It didn't, right?

00:18:03.655 --> 00:18:05.190
His face was covered, right?

00:18:10.795 --> 00:18:12.130
Thankfully, it was covered.

00:18:14.065 --> 00:18:15.667
He was Min Woo's boyfriend.

00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:21.272
When I came here to check,

00:18:22.207 --> 00:18:23.675
he was packing his things.

00:18:24.275 --> 00:18:27.145
He said the blackmailer told him
the moment he reported it,

00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:29.814
everything would be exposed
across the entire university.

00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:31.616
That can't happen.

00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:33.218
That absolutely cannot happen.

00:18:33.218 --> 00:18:35.687
I asked him why he was packing.

00:18:35.887 --> 00:18:36.788
And what did he say?

00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:40.525
The blackmailer demanded 5,000 this time.

00:18:40.525 --> 00:18:41.459
What?

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.331
He couldn't bring himself...

00:18:47.732 --> 00:18:49.167
to ask his mom, who has cancer,
for money again.

00:18:52.504 --> 00:18:56.274
He's not the kind to run away
or cut off contact.

00:18:56.274 --> 00:18:58.176
He's a genuinely good kid.

00:18:58.176 --> 00:19:00.879
He's never once caused trouble
since he was young.

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:04.649
Please send your son's photos
to this number first.

00:19:04.649 --> 00:19:05.884
Okay.

00:19:07.752 --> 00:19:09.120
Nothing serious will happen, right?

00:19:09.854 --> 00:19:12.090
For now, we'll keep tracking his location,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.093
and we'll contact you
as soon as we get a signal.

00:19:15.093 --> 00:19:16.294
Yes, thank you.

00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:20.665
But you said you visited the house
three weeks ago, right?

00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:21.633
Yes.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.201
Does anything come to mind?

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.604
Well,

00:19:30.508 --> 00:19:33.812
he was really struggling with job hunting.

00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:52.364
I'm only telling you this just in case.

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:56.468
I'm the only one who knows...

00:19:57.769 --> 00:19:59.437
that Oh Min Woo likes men.

00:20:04.175 --> 00:20:05.610
What kind of relationship are you two?

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:09.247
I told you already
that we're just friends.

00:20:09.247 --> 00:20:11.049
There's no such thing
between a man and a woman.

00:20:13.184 --> 00:20:16.187
Do you like Min Woo?

00:20:16.688 --> 00:20:17.656
No.

00:20:18.823 --> 00:20:19.758
Not at all.

00:20:22.027 --> 00:20:24.462
Jin Hyeok and Min Woo were together
for a long time.

00:20:25.163 --> 00:20:27.098
They even waited through military service
for each other.

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:29.567
So that makes it years.

00:20:31.369 --> 00:20:32.737
Right. Jin Hyeok is...

00:20:32.737 --> 00:20:33.805
Stop.

00:20:34.806 --> 00:20:36.908
I got the answer to my question.

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:38.710
That's the name of the boy who died.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.779
I said stop.

00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:41.980
I miss them.

00:20:43.415 --> 00:20:45.817
Both Jin Hyeok and Min Woo.

00:20:46.918 --> 00:20:49.254
They're friends I truly love.

00:20:49.554 --> 00:20:51.589
You don't "like" Min Woo,

00:20:53.758 --> 00:20:55.093
but you "love" him?

00:20:55.493 --> 00:20:56.361
Yes.

00:20:57.696 --> 00:20:58.830
I love him.

00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:03.835
Do you think...

00:21:07.205 --> 00:21:09.341
you love Min Woo
more than I do, his mother?

00:21:11.209 --> 00:21:12.210
You know,

00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:14.145
I genuinely...

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.950
worry about and care for Min Woo.

00:21:20.151 --> 00:21:21.453
That's what love is.

00:21:23.088 --> 00:21:25.557
And since we're talking about it,
let me say this.

00:21:27.092 --> 00:21:28.226
In the end,

00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:32.797
look at what happened
to that friend, Jin Hyeok.

00:21:57.088 --> 00:21:59.357
Do you know why Jin Hyeok
didn't send the money?

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.795
He trusted his family.

00:22:04.496 --> 00:22:06.564
He believed
that kind of blackmail wouldn't work.

00:22:06.831 --> 00:22:08.733
That it would be okay
even if it was exposed.

00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:10.035
That's a big dream.

00:22:12.537 --> 00:22:14.973
What kind of parent would support that?

00:22:16.341 --> 00:22:17.909
What kind of parent...

00:22:19.044 --> 00:22:20.078
would encourage it?

00:22:23.415 --> 00:22:24.416
Right.

00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:29.721
So Min Woo's dream was small.

00:22:33.825 --> 00:22:36.027
I'll scrape together
that 5,000 dollars somehow...

00:22:36.027 --> 00:22:37.896
and end it, got it?

00:22:37.896 --> 00:22:39.464
What if the amount keeps going up?

00:22:40.365 --> 00:22:42.133
Will you keep paying whatever they demand?

00:22:42.334 --> 00:22:45.403
The reason the blackmailer
can run wild isn't Min Woo.

00:22:45.403 --> 00:22:47.539
It's people like you.

00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:48.707
Watch your mouth.

00:22:49.407 --> 00:22:51.443
Did I blackmail him? How is this my fault?

00:22:51.443 --> 00:22:53.278
What if he cuts off contact completely?

00:22:54.512 --> 00:22:56.448
What will you do
if you never see him again?

00:22:56.781 --> 00:22:59.851
You say you love him so much,
but you really don't know Min Woo.

00:23:00.418 --> 00:23:02.754
Min Woo would never do that.

00:23:02.754 --> 00:23:03.621
Got it?

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.058
You're being incredibly cruel.

00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:10.562
Why do you keep blaming me?

00:23:10.562 --> 00:23:12.597
You know exactly
what kind of kid Min Woo is,

00:23:13.898 --> 00:23:15.700
and that makes you even more cruel.

00:23:50.068 --> 00:23:53.204
Stepfather and grandmother
don't like rude behavior.

00:23:53.204 --> 00:23:54.539
And what do they like?

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:55.540
Kimchi.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.309
Homemade kimchi.

00:23:58.009 --> 00:23:59.744
You salt the napa cabbage yourself,

00:23:59.744 --> 00:24:01.980
grind apples and pears,

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.715
add salted shrimp and onion syrup,

00:24:03.715 --> 00:24:06.451
then season it with anchovy fish sauce.

00:24:06.451 --> 00:24:08.320
You don't need to know all that.

00:24:08.586 --> 00:24:10.422
But what are you going to do now, Mom?

00:24:11.122 --> 00:24:12.624
You can't eat kimchi.

00:24:12.624 --> 00:24:14.326
You ate kimchi with me
and ended up throwing up.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.129
It's nothing. I'll eat it.

00:24:18.129 --> 00:24:19.998
There's nothing effort can't overcome.

00:24:19.998 --> 00:24:21.833
I tried, but you still couldn't eat it.

00:24:23.935 --> 00:24:24.803
Min Woo.

00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:30.041
We can live like everyone else now.

00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:31.209
Okay?

00:24:31.743 --> 00:24:32.577
Yeah.

00:24:42.487 --> 00:24:43.321
Min Woo.

00:24:44.522 --> 00:24:45.490
Hey.

00:24:46.424 --> 00:24:47.292
What's that?

00:24:48.193 --> 00:24:49.094
Thanks.

00:24:53.798 --> 00:24:54.866
The weather's nice.

00:25:33.271 --> 00:25:35.073
(My Son)

00:25:36.074 --> 00:25:38.109
Hello? Min Woo?

00:25:38.977 --> 00:25:40.111
Min Woo.

00:25:40.378 --> 00:25:41.313
Mom.

00:25:41.713 --> 00:25:42.781
Yeah.

00:25:42.781 --> 00:25:44.516
Sorry I haven't been in touch.

00:25:46.084 --> 00:25:47.819
Are you feeling okay?

00:25:50.755 --> 00:25:51.690
What about you?

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.426
Me? I'm doing fine.

00:25:55.093 --> 00:25:57.662
I was actually thinking of going home
this weekend.

00:25:58.697 --> 00:26:00.465
Do you and Dad have time?

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.200
It's been a while
since we last saw each other.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.101
He's here.

00:26:06.304 --> 00:26:07.172
Hey.

00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:08.473
Actually,

00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:12.377
I have a girlfriend now,
and I wanted to introduce her to you, Mom.

00:26:13.778 --> 00:26:15.180
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

00:26:22.787 --> 00:26:24.556
We really can't eat that much, ma'am.

00:26:25.156 --> 00:26:27.926
You can stop peeling now
and maybe say something too.

00:26:28.193 --> 00:26:29.294
Yes.

00:26:29.294 --> 00:26:30.495
Well, what should I say?

00:26:30.895 --> 00:26:33.932
She's been asking all along
what I was like when I was young.

00:26:34.866 --> 00:26:35.934
I see.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.871
I'll just go to the bathroom for a moment.

00:27:19.277 --> 00:27:21.680
They're suggesting
we go eat kimchi stew nearby.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.081
They say it's a place people line up for.

00:27:26.584 --> 00:27:27.519
I see.

00:27:29.421 --> 00:27:30.555
Okay, let's go.

00:27:33.958 --> 00:27:35.493
Do you feel a bit more at ease?

00:27:35.794 --> 00:27:37.028
I feel uncomfortable...

00:27:40.098 --> 00:27:42.167
watching Min Woo try so hard,

00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:43.268
putting on this ridiculous performance...

00:27:43.268 --> 00:27:45.570
for Min Woo's sake,

00:27:48.306 --> 00:27:51.242
and pretending not to know anything.

00:27:59.217 --> 00:28:01.987
Let's say I understand that.

00:28:03.822 --> 00:28:06.791
But then, what about everyone else?

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.028
Just because one person understands,

00:28:11.396 --> 00:28:12.731
what actually changes?

00:28:13.264 --> 00:28:14.632
What are you, Sailor Moon?

00:28:15.033 --> 00:28:17.369
Who worries about the whole world
these days?

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:35.220
It's good, right?

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.788
My wife and I...

00:28:36.788 --> 00:28:39.524
have been promoting this place
even before it was on TV.

00:28:39.824 --> 00:28:41.626
- It's really good.
- Is it?

00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:44.295
That's a relief. Eat up.

00:28:45.463 --> 00:28:48.400
You're really acting like a man, Min Woo.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.769
Hey, I picked the right menu.

00:28:50.769 --> 00:28:52.737
Seeing you act like that is so cheesy,
so I need kimchi.

00:28:53.538 --> 00:28:56.074
- Just to keep from staining her sleeve.
- Okay.

00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:58.576
Thank you for the meal.

00:29:04.115 --> 00:29:05.650
Look how crowded it is.

00:29:41.286 --> 00:29:43.455
Why? Didn't you sleep?

00:29:45.457 --> 00:29:46.858
Or did you wake up
in the middle of the night?

00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:52.697
Did you two decide to sleep separately?

00:29:53.832 --> 00:29:55.767
We're not at that stage yet.

00:29:58.036 --> 00:30:00.005
But you're at the stage
of bringing her home?

00:30:02.073 --> 00:30:06.111
I just wanted to show her to you and Dad.

00:30:08.647 --> 00:30:09.714
What's that?

00:30:11.483 --> 00:30:14.753
This? It's popular these days.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.554
Let me see.

00:30:17.989 --> 00:30:19.324
Is that popular these days?

00:30:22.093 --> 00:30:23.061
Let me see.

00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:30.268
What's wrong?

00:30:30.268 --> 00:30:32.537
- It's not that, right?
- Why are you suddenly being like this?

00:30:32.871 --> 00:30:34.572
Min Woo, it's not that, right?

00:30:35.607 --> 00:30:38.376
What are you talking about?

00:30:44.482 --> 00:30:45.650
Nothing. Sleep.

00:30:47.052 --> 00:30:48.019
Good night.

00:30:51.923 --> 00:30:52.957
Do you really want to see it?

00:30:58.396 --> 00:30:59.431
What did you say?

00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:02.801
All right, let's see.

00:31:04.102 --> 00:31:05.036
Show me.

00:31:06.838 --> 00:31:08.039
Show me.

00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:12.277
You're not that kind of kid.

00:31:13.912 --> 00:31:14.946
Min Woo.

00:31:16.081 --> 00:31:17.382
You are not that kind of kid.

00:31:18.316 --> 00:31:19.451
Say you're not.

00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:21.653
Say it right now.

00:31:22.887 --> 00:31:24.589
That's not you.

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:42.707
Say it.

00:31:43.074 --> 00:31:45.010
Say that you're not.

00:31:47.445 --> 00:31:50.749
(Deposit 10,000 dollars.
No payment, photos released.)

00:32:05.463 --> 00:32:06.531
Oh Min Woo, where are you going?

00:32:07.298 --> 00:32:09.367
Answer me before you go. Come here.

00:32:09.801 --> 00:32:10.802
Min Woo.

00:32:30.188 --> 00:32:33.024
He's not answering his phone at all.
Where did he go?

00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:35.827
Sae Ra has to go now,

00:32:36.127 --> 00:32:39.130
so I'll drop her off at the terminal
and come back, okay?

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.755
Do you really have to eat it?

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:43.228
I'll take your side, Mom.

00:33:44.262 --> 00:33:47.332
I'll convince them
that some people just don't like kimchi.

00:33:49.434 --> 00:33:50.902
Isn't just me enough?

00:33:54.973 --> 00:33:57.575
At least you have me on your side.

00:33:58.276 --> 00:33:59.110
Okay?

00:34:04.015 --> 00:34:05.383
That's right, Min Woo.

00:34:14.492 --> 00:34:15.527
I...

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:19.297
held on...

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.834
because of you.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:28.640
I...

00:34:30.875 --> 00:34:32.077
survived.

00:34:38.683 --> 00:34:39.651
Every time,

00:34:41.753 --> 00:34:42.654
for me,

00:34:43.955 --> 00:34:44.923
you...

00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:09.981
Do you know where Min Woo might be?

00:35:10.415 --> 00:35:12.117
There's something
I really need to say to him.

00:35:13.051 --> 00:35:14.619
I don't know where he is either.

00:35:17.055 --> 00:35:18.023
But...

00:35:20.325 --> 00:35:21.660
if he went somewhere,

00:35:22.761 --> 00:35:24.362
he probably went to Jin Hyeok.

00:35:26.464 --> 00:35:27.832
The place where his ashes were scattered.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.170
The place where Jin Hyeok was scattered
like he was thrown away.

00:35:39.577 --> 00:35:40.545
Min Woo.

00:35:43.882 --> 00:35:45.016
Min Woo.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.788
Min Woo.

00:35:54.659 --> 00:35:55.827
Min Woo.

00:36:00.265 --> 00:36:01.199
Min Woo.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.102
Min Woo.

00:36:16.247 --> 00:36:17.182
Every time,

00:36:17.882 --> 00:36:20.485
you...

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.754
saved me.

00:36:57.689 --> 00:36:59.224
Mom.

00:37:12.303 --> 00:37:13.204
You...

00:37:13.872 --> 00:37:15.840
never made a mistake.

00:37:17.175 --> 00:37:19.644
So you never failed.

00:37:20.345 --> 00:37:22.314
How did you get here, Mom?

00:37:22.714 --> 00:37:24.916
I made the mistake. I did.

00:37:25.617 --> 00:37:27.352
So don't let me fail...

00:37:27.352 --> 00:37:28.653
by carrying this alone.

00:37:31.823 --> 00:37:32.824
I was wrong.

00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:35.694
Please, just give me one chance.

00:37:37.329 --> 00:37:40.765
I was wrong, okay?

00:37:40.765 --> 00:37:41.666
I'm sorry.

00:37:42.334 --> 00:37:43.301
I'm sorry.

00:37:50.909 --> 00:37:51.843
Let me see.

00:38:12.998 --> 00:38:14.232
Let's go.

00:38:16.101 --> 00:38:17.235
Let's go together.

00:38:21.006 --> 00:38:22.173
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:38:25.577 --> 00:38:26.544
I'm not going.

00:38:28.513 --> 00:38:29.447
Min Woo.

00:38:31.783 --> 00:38:33.318
Let's go to the police station together.

00:38:37.789 --> 00:38:39.424
Let's go together.

00:38:54.806 --> 00:38:55.740
It's okay.

00:39:02.514 --> 00:39:03.415
It's okay.

00:39:06.184 --> 00:39:07.719
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:24.803
Honey, what is all this?

00:39:24.803 --> 00:39:27.439
The house is a mess,
you're not answering your phone,

00:39:27.439 --> 00:39:28.773
and now the police station?

00:39:28.773 --> 00:39:31.609
There's something
I need to tell you, honey.

00:39:32.344 --> 00:39:33.278
What is it?

00:39:34.312 --> 00:39:36.881
Well, what I mean is...

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.722
about the kimchi.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.658
Kimchi?

00:39:46.658 --> 00:39:50.261
Why did it take me 15 years to say this?

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.398
Over something so small.

00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:55.800
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.535
This is nothing.

00:39:57.535 --> 00:39:59.537
So why did I never even show it,

00:40:00.972 --> 00:40:04.175
and try so desperately like that?

00:40:05.176 --> 00:40:07.779
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

00:40:09.481 --> 00:40:10.448
Exactly.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.719
If I say that a little over a month...

00:40:16.054 --> 00:40:19.524
is still too short a time for me,

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.395
would that make sense?

00:40:24.129 --> 00:40:27.432
If the only thing
I can barely understand...

00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:32.237
is just kimchi,

00:40:33.805 --> 00:40:36.007
would Min Woo understand?

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.046
Honey, you're scaring me now.

00:40:43.982 --> 00:40:45.383
I really...

00:40:50.588 --> 00:40:51.423
Min Woo.

00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:03.735
hate kimchi.

00:41:09.474 --> 00:41:13.945
(Kimchi)

00:41:39.637 --> 00:41:41.637
