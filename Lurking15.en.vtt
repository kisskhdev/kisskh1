00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.600
Let me get it.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.439
Okay.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.439
Weren't you supposed
to choose a wedding dress today?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.400
Go first.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.799
I'll be there soon.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.640
Okay.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:15.920
Then come early.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:23.920
Won't you come out?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.840
Let's go.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:34.719
I'll see you out.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.159
Give me back my phone.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.560
Delete the video.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.760
Help me find Zhao Yan first.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.000
Then I'll delete the video.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:01:58.880
(Li Weiwei)

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.480
Are you going to delete it or not?

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.640
No way.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.680
Don't blame me for speaking up.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.479
What do you want to do?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.479
Nian?

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:13.840
Give me back my phone.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.520
Give it back.

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.919
Nian?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.719
Give it back.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.199
Why aren't you talking?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.800
I saw the bar's surveillance.

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.560
It was Song Qian who took you away.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.560
You didn't sleep with him, did you?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.080
You really seduced him?

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.599
Li Weiwei, shut up.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.919
What's wrong?

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:32.919
Why are you upset?

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.599
Didn't you say before
that although he's annoying,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.199
at least he looks alright?

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.000
You must have enjoyed it, right?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.840
Li Weiwei, you...

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.199
Why are you mad?

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.319
Are you dissatisfied with him?

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.599
What about me dissatisfies you?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.479
Mr. Song, don't misunderstand.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.560
Please help me find Zhao Yan soon.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.199
Then we can call it even.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.159
Call it even?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.199
You slept with me.

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.280
How can we call it even?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.560
I...

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.159
I didn't sleep with you.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.879
Did you forget
what you did to me last night?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.400
I remember I didn't sleep with you.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400
Stop acting indecently.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.199
If you don't want me
to act indecently with you,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.960
delete the video now.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.080
Why do you look for Zhao Yan?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.039
He owes me money.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.080
If you don't tell me the truth,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.960
I can't help you find him.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.400
If you don't help,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.159
I'll find another way.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.199
What exactly do you want?

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.960
Open the door.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.639
(Outpatient)
Okay, I got it.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.039
Nian?

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.719
Nian.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.319
Open the door, Nian.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.719
Nian.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.439
He's connected to my mom's death.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.480
Is that enough?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.279
Nian, open the door.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:24.720
Delete the video.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.000
Then I'll help you find him.

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:31.319
Nian.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.199
There was never a video.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.160
Gu Nian,

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:38.720
you're something.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.759
Your trick never fails.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.720
When can you find him?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.319
I only agreed to look for him

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.480
but not to find him.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.560
You lied to me again.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.360
Open the door, Nian.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.560
So did you.

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:56.720
What else do you want?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.959
Open the door!

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:59.519
Song Qian,

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.240
open the door.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.199
You like him?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.079
I thought you liked that guy named K.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.560
Yes,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.439
I do like him.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.360
But who I like has nothing
to do with you, right?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.920
You're not K.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.639
Open the door, Nian.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:21.399
Song Qian, let me be clear.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:22.600
You have a fiancée.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.439
Avoid actions
that cause misunderstandings.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.000
Okay?

00:05:25.462 --> 00:05:27.232
♪Without your company♪

00:05:27.414 --> 00:05:30.679
♪I'm truly not used to it♪

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.040
Open the door.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.759
Nian,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.920
are you okay?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.856
Weiwei and I looked for you all night.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.920
Did you and he...

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.319
I have nothing to do with him.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.879
(Didn't I warn you)

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.199
(not to develop any feelings for me?)

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.720
Even if I had feelings for you,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.079
we could never be together.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.160
We've faked an amnesia case for you.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.439
Your identity now is Song Qian.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.000
(Make sure)

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.879
(to sever the past.)

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.800
(Or you'll be in great danger.)

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.040
Gu Nian,

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.439
why harass him again?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.319
Next one.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.279
Dr. Gu, the chief wants to see you.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.279
(Why would the chief ask me
to come to the warehouse?)

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.639
Who are you?

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.600
How did you get in?

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.720
Gu Nian,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.000
you've offended someone
you shouldn't have.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:02.279
Someone paid for your life.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.759
You can't escape.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.959
Let me go.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.360
And I'll pay you double.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.079
No matter how much you pay today,
you won't leave alive.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:18.319
Get her.

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:20.959
If I must die,

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:22.560
tell me who sent you.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.800
Alright.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.680
I can tell you.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.160
You seduced her fiancé.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.360
(Wei Qing?)

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.639
Tie her up.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.560
I've recorded everything

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.439
you said.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.560
If you kill me,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.959
it'll be uploaded to the cloud.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.040
The police will know
you killed me by then.

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.000
But if you let me go,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.040
I'll delete the recording.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680
Why did you start a fire?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.399
Boss, we didn't do it.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:55.519
It's on fire.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.639

Mr. Song, bad news.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.920

Qian,

was saving Gu Nian worth your life?

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.240
You instigated
the warehouse fire, didn't you?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.320
Have you ever thought

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.159
how much trouble that would cause

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:04.519
if she died there?

how could you think that of me?

I couldn't?

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.799
I caught the people who set the fire.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:14.360
They said you instructed them.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.519
She's been harassing you.

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:19.799
You had people set the fire
just because of that?

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.159
I just wanted to scare her.

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:23.919

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.600
If I hadn't arrived in time,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.320
she'd have died.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.480

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.480

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:41.879
Do you know instigating arson
can land you in prison?

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.279
No, it won't.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.879
My brother will cover it for me.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:47.320
If the police find evidence,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.120
he can't help you.

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:51.360
I only told Li Yong to scare her.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:52.879
I didn't instigate arson.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.879
Qian, believe me.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:57.960
I didn't want to kill her.

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:00.559
I don't want jail time.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:01.799
Help me.

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:03.960
(She doesn't seem to lie.)

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.960
(If it's not her,)

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.320
(who exactly wants to harm Gu Nian?)

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.320
(Yesterday, there was a fire
at the Wei Group's warehouse.)

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:15.399
(A trapped women was rescued in time.)

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:18.279
(Police found large traces
of gasoline around the warehouse.)

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.879
(Preliminary police assessment)

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.039
(suspected arson.)

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.200
Gu Nian.
