- Just go! Now!
- You're a darn fox!

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.008
I won't forgive you!

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.177
She's a devilish fox!

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.718
I WAS AFRAID

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:59.096
THAT I SHARED
SOMETHING IN COMMON

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.473
WITH SOMEONE
I NEVER WANTED TO BE LIKE.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.524
No, stop the press.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.360
Yes, we're friendly.
But we've never crossed the line.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.654
I'd like to apologize.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.116
I NEEDED TO PROVE

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.827
THAT I WASN'T HIM.

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:27.499
You're just leaving like this?

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.292
You're really leaving?

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:31.837
Uh…

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.590
I didn't think it through.
I didn't think how you'd feel.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.510
Do I feel like a burden? Is that why?

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.388
- Seoyoung…
- Hmm.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.348
…our movie's over.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:45.851
What do you mean?

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.353
I was just using you.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.315
I used your feelings for me
during the shoot.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.486
That's all.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.282
I simply led you on.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.951
And now,

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.911
I have to make it right.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.466
I NEEDED TO PROVE

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.927
I WOULD NEVER MAKE
THE SAME CHOICES

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.264
AS MY FATHER DID.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.901
Was that enough?

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:41.698
Not bad for a rehearsal,

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:44.075
but your left shoulder
tends to shake a bit.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.537
It'll probably be worse
when we start filming.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.834
It'll be noticeable on camera.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:53.919
It'll look…

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:57.005
like you're bobbing.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.882
Ah.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.765
My shoulder?

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.642
What's wrong with that?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.645
It's not right to use me this way.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.104
I'm not an actor, you know.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.274
Y-yes, of course.

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.402
I guess that didn't really help.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.697
I'm sorry

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.908
that I wasn't much help.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.001
Still…

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:36.837
it wasn't that bad.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:07.742
EPISODE 5

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.458
Hello!

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.673
Wow, Ms. Go.
You're full of energy this morning--

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.925
Help me sign Lee Daeum.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.970
Straight to the point, as always.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.847
I saw she's got a manager now.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.432
Who is he? He wasn't family.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.975
Oh, just some guy Director Lee knows.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.853
So he's the one who set it up?

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.440
What did he say to make her turn me down?

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:39.774
Daeum turned you down?

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.109
She shut me out completely.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.861
And that only made me want her more.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.739
Give me her info. Background,
experience, education, everything.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:49.618
You should hire a private investigator
if you want all that.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.536
Mmm. Mmm.

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:55.957
Come on,

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.834
let's help each other like the old days.

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.754
I'm dying to sign Lee Daeum, okay?

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.339
Ms. Go,

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.966
I'm only saying this for your sake.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.011
It's better for you
not to sign with Daeum.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.013
Seriously? Even you?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.807
I just said it's for your own sake.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.976
I wouldn't sign her if I were you.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.062
Forget it! I'll find another way.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.735
I'm late. Hey, Daeum!

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:27.656
How long are you going to sleep?
Get up! I need to be at work soon.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.866
You told me to wake you.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.410
Daeum?

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.622
Mom! Mom!

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.753
Daeum was out in the rain
for a bit yesterday.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:42.962
That explains it.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.756
No wonder this happened.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.301
What were you doing
while she ended up like this?

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.346
Let her sleep another hour,
then wake her up and get her to eat.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.598
Doctor, don't mention this to Daeum's…

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:57.977
Hey.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.607
- Hello again.
- Hello.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.360
Is her fever down?

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:08.113
Yes. I'm sorry, Dr. Lee.
I take responsibility for--

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.280
Why are you sorry?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.242
- Let's admit her.
- Pardon?

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.451
- Oh my. Sir…
- But…

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.577
Gyoyeong.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.663
That's it.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.374
Daeum's not leaving
the hospital anymore. Got it?

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.625
Ah…

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.879
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.632
- Dr. Kim.
- Yes?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.759
Send me this director guy's number
right away.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.720
Yes, sir.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:36.641
Goodness.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:40.311
Dr. Lee, please calm down
and just listen to her side of the story.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:44.691
Ah. Patient Lee Daeum in Room 1205
is no longer allowed to leave.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.401
- Dr. Lee, wait…
- Oh.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.904
Send me the director's number
so I can check it as I go downstairs.

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.990
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.714
LEE DAEUM

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.799
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.724
CALL

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.559
LIM JUNBYUNG

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.025
Hey, Junbyung. Let me ask you a favor.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.570
I'm here, but nobody's home.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:34.032
- <i>She's not answering your calls?</i>
- No. Did something happen yesterday?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.366
No, nothing happened.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:40.246
She came to ask something about the script
and left not long after.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.627
Hang on.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.507
Yes, hello?

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.106
ROOM 511, KIM MINSEOK
SPECIALTY: NEUROSURGERY

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.233
Surgery isn't really an option right now.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.861
Even admission is just my recommendation.
I doubt she would agree to it.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:12.987
NEUROSURGERY
KIM MINSEOK

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:39.430
Hey…

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.642
Where are you going?

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:44.686
You know where.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:45.770
Gyoyeong…

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.024
I don't want to be here.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.485
You're not okay.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.570
You can't go.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.822
But I have to go.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.657
Director Lee's waiting for me.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.910
Your father's going to meet
with that director right now.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:01.995
Exactly.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.872
That's why I have to be there.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.711
Hey.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.255
How can you be so selfish?

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.258
You know I have to go make that movie.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.761
You're the one
who was the happiest for me.

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.722
I'm happy for you.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:21.806
I was happy.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.018
But you shouldn't have fainted, then.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.478
Gyoyeong.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.112
Listen to me.

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:39.908
Do you think I enjoy doing this
when my friend wants to do what she likes?

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.619
I'm scared.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.456
I'm scared something might happen to you.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.875
Just this morning,

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.712
do you know how scared I was
when you wouldn't wake up?

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:02.305
I'm sorry.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.183
I'm sorry, Gyoyeong.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.523
But, Gyoyeong…

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:14.525
look at me.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:17.904
Don't I look different?

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.990
Being in this movie
means so much to me right now.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.618
So call me selfish all you want…

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:29.207
but becoming Gyuwon
makes me happier than ever.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.462
I'm sorry.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.846
Help me out.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:58.736
Yes, Manager?

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:01.781
I took the morning off.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:03.825
Yes.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.290
Yes?

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:12.959
Hello, Doctor.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.961
- Who are you?
- Ah.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:19.173
Ah. Aha.

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:21.092
Nice to see you again.

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:24.304
Yes, I heard a lot about you
from Director Lee.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:25.680
So you're our consultant?

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:29.600
I thought your character
didn't need consulting.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.144
What exactly is wrong with Daeum?

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:36.399
Ah. I'm not the type
to beat around the bush.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.651
I know Daeum is sick.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.196
I can't tell you
a patient's personal information.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.532
That line appears often in movies too.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.243
In movies, they dig it up some other way.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.495
Why do you want to know this?

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:50.621
Hmm.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.416
Daeum…

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.585
is trying to make a movie,

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.087
and I want to help her.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.048
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.301
But even so,

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.512
there's nothing I can tell you here.

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.222
I have to ask you to leave.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.898
CINEMA JONGNO

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:20.068
I couldn't think of a quiet place to talk.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.446
This is nice and quiet enough.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.532
I'm sorry.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.618
I know it's out of line,

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.746
but I got your contact info
from Dr. Kim Minseok.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.791
No, that's fine. What did you want to say?

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.501
Well…

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.753
Was it a "table read"?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.256
The day before her table read,
Daeum told me that she was…

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.676
so happy she could die.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.347
For her to say those words,

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.890
she must've really wanted…

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:53.726
to do this acting thing.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.937
Yes, she's doing very well.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:01.442
I should be happy to hear
my daughter is doing well,

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.194
but it's hard for me.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:08.991
I'm sure you've had a lot on your mind
after hearing of Daeum's condition.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.787
I heard you're keeping it a secret
from everyone else.

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:14.622
Yes, for her sake,

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:16.958
I plan to keep it a secret
until filming is over.

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.042
Is that so?

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:21.712
But if you really do care about her,

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.756
instead of keeping secrets,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.259
shouldn't you be letting her
go to the hospital

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.386
to help her live longer?

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.224
I'm trying to honor her wishes.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.102
I'll keep communicating with her
about her condition

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:39.355
and try my best to care for her.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.942
But Daeum's not well enough
to finish this movie.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.154
She can barely get through the day.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:49.991
We'll arrange the schedule for her
and finish as quickly as possible.

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.160
And what if she has a seizure on set?

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.997
If she misses a single dose,
or a single meal,

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:59.041
that could be it for her.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.587
Does filming a movie matter more
than someone's life?

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.632
You'll try your best?

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.676
My daughter's life is on the line,

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.387
and the best is all you can do?

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.976
That's truly irresponsible of you.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.526
Is it fun making a terminal patient
play a terminal character?

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:29.113
Is this how all movies are?

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.924
There's nothing I can tell you here.

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.175
I have to ask you to leave.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.971
1205, LEE DAEUM, CHECK REGULARLY

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:00.061
<i>Twelfth floor.</i>

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.281
Make a choice, Daeum.

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:14.492
Option one,

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.577
walking out of here,

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:20.289
doing everything you've only
ever dreamed of, and then dying.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.416
Option two,

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.127
staying here

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.505
and living longer.

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.677
But you won't be able to do anything.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.137
It'll be miserable.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.018
That's a tough choice.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:44.772
Is it?

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.109
It's easy for me.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.654
Daeum!

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.448
The doctor was looking for you.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.284
Oh! I forgot.

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.452
- Let's talk later, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.090
THE LATE KIM MINJEONG

00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:48.878
<i>Every day in the hospital,</i>

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.880
<i>I couldn't stop picturing it.</i>

00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.596
<i>What kind of life…</i>

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.058
<i>would I have led if I left this place?</i>

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:10.232
I know I need to go--

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.401
<i>I asked if Daeum got any better!</i>

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.572
Mom, I'll explain everything later.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.533
<i>Why do you keep rambling</i>
<i>about the weirdest--</i>

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.747
<i>The heroine of a movie,</i>

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.707
<i>a fairy-tale romance,</i>

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:29.502
<i>and a "happily ever after" in the end.</i>

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:34.173
<i>Real life was always out there,</i>
<i>beyond the hospital.</i>

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.233
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:01.909
<i>First floor.</i>

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:26.726
Yes, Doctor?

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.353
Ms. Lee Daeum?

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.313
What?

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.732
She's not in her room?

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:34.859
She was there a minute ago.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.820
Gyuwon.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.573
When was the last time you slept?

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:43.075
You're on call today again, right?

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:46.287
I never get to eat with my own sister.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.455
Aren't you hungry?

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.250
How about a sandwich?

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:54.462
I'll head back up there. Okay.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:03.345
If we want sandwiches,
how about a little drive to Forestin?

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:04.889
<i>Basement level two.</i>

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:22.448
It's been a while, Dr. Lee.

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:24.450
Yes, hello.

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:38.297
<i>The outside world turned out</i>
<i>to be tougher than I thought.</i>

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:42.218
<i>But I don't want to give up.</i>

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:56.732
<i>Dad.</i>

00:21:57.399 --> 00:22:00.986
<i>Can you leave the rest of our time to me?</i>

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.656
<i>I want to choose my own ending.</i>

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:16.502
Where should I take you?

00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:29.515
I don't really have anywhere
I can go right now.

00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:32.935
Give me a minute.

00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:39.358
Anywhere safe is good enough, right?

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.444
I'll figure it out. Just rest.

00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.481
Don't get up. Make yourself comfortable.

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:20.774
Oh. Okay.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.651
Well…

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:25.779
You can take the room upstairs.

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:28.532
Want to go up and rest?

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.327
Or do you want something to eat?

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.120
Wait, I guess you can't just eat anything.

00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:34.872
M-Ms. Chae.

00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:36.957
I'll just be upstairs.

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:41.545
Of course. You should get some rest first.

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:43.631
Ms. Chae,

00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:45.007
thank you so much.

00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:56.185
THE LONELY PEOPLE

00:24:01.357 --> 00:24:02.358
MISSED CALLS:
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:03.442
MISSED CALLS: DAD

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:26.924
<i>Is it fun making a terminal</i>
<i>patient play a terminal character?</i>

00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:29.635
<i>Is this how all movies are?</i>

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:37.351
LEE DAEUM

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:46.276
LEE DAEUM

00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:49.780
Why weren't you answering?

00:24:49.863 --> 00:24:50.948
Where are you?

00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:54.076
I wasn't really in a situation
where I could pick up.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.537
I'm sorry I made you worry.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.247
What kind of situation?

00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:00.332
<i>I was at the hospital…</i>

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.378
but I ran away
because I was scared I'd have to stay.

00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:06.839
So where are you now?

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.465
<i>Uh…</i>

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:11.260
I'm at Ms. Seoyoung's.

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:13.679
I ran into her at the hospital

00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:17.516
- <i>and asked her to help me out.</i>
- Where did you say you were?

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:20.060
Do you mind if I explain more tomorrow?

00:25:20.144 --> 00:25:21.854
I promise I'll tell you everything.

00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:23.022
Stay there, I'm on my way.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:24.732
Pardon?

00:25:24.815 --> 00:25:26.191
I said, wait there for me.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:33.282
Thank you for the meal.

00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:36.660
But why aren't you eating anything?

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.954
I gave up rice three years ago.

00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:41.248
Oh.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.590
Can I ask why you were at the hospital?

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:52.718
Ah.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.970
Prescriptions from psych.

00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:56.680
I have a lot of stress and anxiety.

00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:58.724
Has it been that rough?

00:25:58.807 --> 00:26:01.643
Yes. I've been going for a while.

00:26:02.853 --> 00:26:05.314
I didn't expect to see you there, though.

00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:08.233
Like what happened before…

00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:10.277
Can you tell me about that now?

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:12.654
I'm just worried about you.

00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:15.115
I-It just…

00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:17.659
It just happens sometimes, not very often.

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:19.828
You don't have to worry about that.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:21.663
It's really nothing.

00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:22.748
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:26.293
Sorry, I need to take this.

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.421
Yeah, what's up?

00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.508
<i>I'll be at your place soon.</i>

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.301
Why would you come to my place?

00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:36.887
To get Daeum.

00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:39.598
How did you know she was here?

00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:43.310
She told me she was there.

00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:50.317
But why are you coming to get her?

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.612
I don't think
I need to explain myself to you.

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:20.055
Come in.

00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:32.401
Mr. Lee.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.071
Let's go.

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:40.534
You'll make things weird
if you go like this, you know.

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:43.787
Shouldn't you at least
explain what's going on?

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.544
Do you need help like you did earlier?

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.713
It's not like that, Ms. Chae.

00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.966
Go downstairs and wait in the car.
I'll be right down.

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.970
- Mr. Lee…
- Go downstairs.

00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:17.362
See you.

00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:18.447
What?

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.617
You didn't explain anything.

00:28:22.743 --> 00:28:24.411
What are you hiding?

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:27.456
I can't pretend not to notice anymore.
Explain before you go.

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:31.710
Why were you at the hospital?
How did you run into Daeum?

00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.378
And why did you bring her here?

00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:40.510
I don't understand
why you get so worked up about Daeum.

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.513
I saw something and wanted to know why.

00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:44.973
You two are hiding something from me.

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:48.185
It doesn't concern you.

00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:49.978
Why are you acting so weird?

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.105
Why are you so unpredictable?

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:58.028
I was excited and nervous
to work with you again.

00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:01.490
Honestly, it felt like the old days
and I started acting on impulse.

00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:05.661
But you keep acting in strange ways
like someone I don't even recognize.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.081
Why are you doing this? What's the reason?

00:29:09.665 --> 00:29:13.543
Because I'm not someone who exists
to act the way you want or predict.

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.674
That's something you should expect
from someone who loves you.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.133
Not me.

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:41.738
Why do I keep running into Seoyoung?

00:29:41.822 --> 00:29:43.281
Is it destiny?

00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:45.784
I heard you were unwell.

00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:47.536
Are you okay now?

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:49.162
I'm fine.

00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:51.164
I'll tell you if I'm really not okay.

00:29:51.248 --> 00:29:52.499
You don't need to worry.

00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:56.044
Let's go to the hospital.

00:29:57.421 --> 00:29:58.672
No, I can't go there.

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.135
Why are you so reckless
when you know you can't handle it?

00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:04.928
We're about to start shooting.

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:08.015
If your condition worsens, 70 or 80 people
will have to stop everything.

00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:10.058
Even if you're new,

00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:13.645
a lead actor should at least have some
basic sense of professionalism.

00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:15.397
If I go back to the hospital now,

00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:18.066
I'll just lie there until I die.

00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:20.110
That's my reality.

00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:22.070
I don't care if you yell at me.

00:30:22.154 --> 00:30:24.990
It's a million times better
for me to be out in the world.

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.867
Keep yelling, I can take it all.

00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:29.327
And I'm not being reckless right now.

00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:31.288
I got out because I'm desperate.

00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:33.999
Mr. Lee, can you please give me this?

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:38.754
I'll take you to your friend's.

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.797
I can't go there today.

00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:44.760
Where, then?

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.431
Somewhere you'd never want to go.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.849
What?

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:52.601
A place that's your version
of my hospital.

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:55.687
Don't you have a place like that?

00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:21.630
Is this the place you never want to go?

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:24.883
Yeah.

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:28.845
I've been wondering this since last time.

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:32.224
Why do you ask about the worst food

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:34.267
and the worst places?

00:31:38.188 --> 00:31:39.314
I'm just curious.

00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:44.486
I want to know what you like, don't like,

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:47.030
everything.

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:57.707
Come in.

00:32:27.404 --> 00:32:28.405
Take this room.

00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:31.158
What is this place?

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.785
My childhood home.

00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:37.080
Ah. No wonder.

00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:39.541
I looks like it hasn't been
maintained in a while,

00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:43.378
but it feels grand and cozy
at the same time.

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.755
A little eerie, but feels antique.

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:47.299
It suits you, actually.

00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:48.550
Suits me? Please.

00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:52.846
But why don't you like this place?

00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.307
Use this room, okay?

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.058
Bathroom's over there.

00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:58.476
Just stay here for the night,

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.686
and after that…

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:03.481
Let's figure that out later.

00:33:04.107 --> 00:33:05.317
Where are you going?

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.152
I have my own place.

00:33:07.903 --> 00:33:10.822
What? This isn't some guesthouse.

00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:15.368
You can't just throw me some guidelines
and walk away.

00:33:27.214 --> 00:33:29.049
Did you tell your father you're here?

00:33:31.718 --> 00:33:32.802
You should tell him.

00:33:34.304 --> 00:33:35.722
You're not a kid.

00:33:40.227 --> 00:33:42.395
He doesn't want you
to do this movie, right?

00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.399
I guess you met my dad.

00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:51.529
I won't tell you to do
whatever your father says.

00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:53.281
I never did with mine.

00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:54.366
Was your father…

00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:57.953
against you making films too?

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.038
Not sure.

00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:03.625
He would've at least been against me
remaking <i>Love in White</i>.

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.834
Hmm.

00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:09.005
Can I ask, if you don't mind?

00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.548
You said that…

00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:16.638
you didn't think your father was actually
the one who wrote <i>Love in White</i>.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:17.931
Let's change the subject.

00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:19.057
Oh.

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.854
I honestly don't know what to do.

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.275
I understand how my dad feels…

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:33.321
but I can't live how he wants me to.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:39.536
But your father's a doctor who understands
your condition better than anyone.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.121
Exactly.

00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:44.082
That's what makes me so scared.

00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:47.627
He can't accept it because he's a doctor.

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:49.879
Can we change the subject?

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:57.012
I'll head out now.

00:34:58.471 --> 00:34:59.889
Mr. Lee!

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:04.519
I'm sorry.

00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:06.855
I'm terribly sorry.

00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:09.316
About what?

00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:11.026
You know, last time…

00:35:12.027 --> 00:35:14.195
When I forced you to…

00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:16.489
You know.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.243
I'm sorry.

00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:24.706
Who apologizes that seriously for a kiss?

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:28.752
Wouldn't acting like it didn't happen
be even weirder?

00:35:29.336 --> 00:35:30.629
You don't have to apologize.

00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:33.798
If anything,
I should be the one to be sorry.

00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:37.302
Even if it was practice, you had to kiss
someone you don't even like.

00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:40.889
Mmm.

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.436
How many times have you apologized today?

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:47.812
H-How many times?

00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:50.649
Mmm…

00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:55.737
Hmm?

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:59.074
Think you can finish this film
if you keep apologizing like that?

00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:02.619
Open your hand again.

00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:14.297
I know your heart's in the right place,
but stop apologizing so much.

00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:16.174
If you want to do
what you've always wanted,

00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:17.634
you'll have to…

00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:19.886
learn how to deal with feelings like that.

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:27.102
You said you're a terminal patient
who could do anything.

00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:33.024
You're someone
who can do anything, aren't you?

00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:35.026
So stop belittling yourself.

00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:53.503
Don't touch anything in this house.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.923
Not a thing.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.376
WATER, GRAPE 100,
SEAWEED SNACK, COOKIES

00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:12.499
"GRANDMA'S TABLE" NEARBY
IS REALLY GOOD.

00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:15.376
LEFT THE STUFF YOU NEED
BY THE DOOR.

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:47.826
GRAPE 100

00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:19.399
Hmm.

00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:24.112
Hmm?

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.324
Is that Mr. Lee? He's so cute…

00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:30.535
<i>Don't touch anything in this house.</i>

00:39:31.286 --> 00:39:32.579
Uh…

00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:34.706
<i>Not a thing.</i>

00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:41.713
<i>Not a thing.</i>

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:02.817
You're coming along?

00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:05.153
Why not? It'll save gas.

00:40:06.613 --> 00:40:08.531
It's uncomfortable sharing a car.

00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:14.579
Director Park's looking for a new lead
for his next project.

00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:15.663
So what?

00:40:16.623 --> 00:40:17.624
Let's do it.

00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:20.668
You made a strong comeback
with him last time.

00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:22.420
The divorce got buried too.

00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:26.382
Ms. Go,
didn't we already sign for <i>Love in White</i>?

00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:28.927
You don't even have
much screen time in that.

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.637
Just shoot all your scenes at once.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.847
You'll be credited
as a special appearance.

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:35.391
I want to focus on being Junghwa.

00:40:35.475 --> 00:40:38.686
You're not the kind of actress
who can't handle two roles.

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.107
Don't drink when you get there.

00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:45.360
You want me to tough it out sober?

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:48.071
The hospital called.
They said meds alone won't help.

00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:53.159
Yes, Mr. Kim?

00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:56.287
Ms. Go and Seoyoung just went in.

00:40:56.371 --> 00:40:57.747
The timing's perfect, then.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:58.957
I'll be there to get her.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.625
How is she feeling?

00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:02.835
Uh… What are the vibes there?

00:41:02.919 --> 00:41:04.504
I don't think it'll take long.

00:41:04.587 --> 00:41:06.923
She said she's not even drinking.

00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:27.151
I think she might drink a little.

00:41:27.986 --> 00:41:29.404
Here is this week's status.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.864
The bookstore will likely
be completed this week.

00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:33.533
HAVE YOU EATEN

00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:34.951
The sea breeze gave us a hard time,

00:41:35.034 --> 00:41:37.412
but we expect
to finish construction this week.

00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:43.001
Mr. Lee.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.339
You seem tired, Mr. Lee.
Shall we wrap up for today?

00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:52.051
We have a lot of scenes
tracking the leads' eyes,

00:41:52.135 --> 00:41:54.012
so the DP may have a tough time.

00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:56.097
Since it's not a set,

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.391
I'll need to check
the locations in person.

00:41:58.474 --> 00:42:00.435
I'll add that to the scouting schedule.

00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:06.315
Are we running a bit short on time?

00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.694
Well, I expected this and prepped ahead.

00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:12.238
If you can just confirm
the remaining locations,

00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:13.489
we'll have enough time.

00:42:14.323 --> 00:42:15.783
Gosh. Sorry, I'm late.

00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:17.285
- Hello.
- Welcome.

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:18.703
What kept you so long?

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.165
Got stuck listening
to <i>Terms of Jealousy</i>'s producer vent.

00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:24.250
Isn't that coming out soon?

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.002
It's chaos over there.

00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:27.378
What? Why?

00:42:27.462 --> 00:42:28.588
There was a scandal.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.798
The director and the lead.

00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:36.054
Didn't Director Jungin spend six months
in auditions and cast a rookie?

00:42:36.137 --> 00:42:38.514
Is dating that big a deal?

00:42:38.598 --> 00:42:40.016
Happens all the time.

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:42.769
Yeah, if they're dating quietly.

00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:46.105
But he was two-timing…

00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:48.775
both of the female leads.

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:57.450
HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING?

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.079
<i>The call cannot be connected</i>

00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:02.580
<i>and will be forwarded to voicemail--</i>

00:43:02.663 --> 00:43:03.664
LEE DAEUM

00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:14.175
What?

00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:17.637
You've been staring. Got something to say?

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.348
Bit rude, aren't you?

00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:22.266
I'll go if it's nothing.

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:25.103
That kind of mess can't happen on our set,

00:43:25.186 --> 00:43:26.687
and obviously won't, right?

00:43:28.898 --> 00:43:30.024
What kind of mess?

00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:32.360
A disaster caused by one stupid decision.

00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:36.781
That's not happening on my set, okay?

00:43:37.907 --> 00:43:39.200
It won't.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.910
Don't waste your energy worrying.

00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:44.872
There's no fixing it
if we end up like <i>Terms of Jealousy</i>.

00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:46.082
Okay?

00:43:57.844 --> 00:44:01.389
At this point, Seoyoung is practically
your muse, isn't she?

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.682
Of course, she is.

00:44:04.267 --> 00:44:05.560
Sorry.

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:06.978
I'm just thirsty.

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.151
This is strong stuff.

00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:17.613
Hey, I like the vibes today.

00:44:17.697 --> 00:44:20.116
You're very gutsy, Seoyoung.
That's why I like you.

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:22.702
The script's solid,
and the character is fantastic.

00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:24.662
And it's Director Park's film, after all.

00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:26.289
Seoyoung has to do it.

00:44:27.123 --> 00:44:29.292
Since you like gutsy, I'll show you gutsy.

00:44:31.294 --> 00:44:32.545
I'm the one who's acting.

00:44:34.172 --> 00:44:37.341
Not Ms. Go, not the director,
not the producer, but me.

00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:42.847
I haven't even seen the script,

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.141
but I'm supposed to step in
for an actress who bailed

00:44:45.224 --> 00:44:47.977
because the director was a nightmare?
It makes no sense.

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:51.689
Odds are he'll act the same
toward me. Right?

00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:53.608
That's enough.

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:57.486
I come first.

00:44:59.322 --> 00:45:00.990
My feelings come first.

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:12.460
Do you have anything else to say to me?

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.172
Then say it behind my back.

00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:27.183
One moment, Mr. Park.

00:45:33.064 --> 00:45:34.273
You're nuts.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.776
If I'm nuts,

00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:39.028
then you're just heartless.

00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:40.112
Know your place.

00:45:40.196 --> 00:45:42.365
You're a divorcée
about to hit your mid-30s.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.659
You want to throw away the lead?

00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:45.910
Go back and apologize.

00:45:46.953 --> 00:45:47.954
Divorcée?

00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:51.999
A 30-something desperate for a lead role?

00:45:53.376 --> 00:45:57.380
So that's how the person
I thought knew me best sees me.

00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:58.756
You want to hit rock bottom?

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:00.675
Director Park…

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:03.844
always rewrites scenes last minute
just to get actresses naked.

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:05.221
Don't you know that?

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.640
I'm still on meds because of that.

00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:09.809
And you want me to work with him again?

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:12.228
Isn't that too cruel? I'm human too!

00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:13.854
Just focus on the results.

00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:16.232
- Don't think about--
- How can I not think about that?

00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:18.067
I feel like I'm about to explode--

00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:27.326
Do you think
I enjoy sucking up to those pricks?

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:29.120
Go back in there.

00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:31.414
Go back and apologize.

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.419
This is why I came here.

00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:39.797
To make sure Director Park
never asks for me again.

00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:41.757
And that blasted lead?

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:46.220
Find someone else
who'll do whatever you say.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.540
Stop that, it hurts.

00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:17.043
You drank a lot, huh?

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.046
I wasn't planning to,

00:47:20.713 --> 00:47:21.714
but I did a bit.

00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:24.842
I didn't want to,

00:47:26.218 --> 00:47:27.803
but I had to do it, like it or not.

00:47:30.598 --> 00:47:31.932
Let's go to the car first.

00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:35.394
I…

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:40.066
I burned my bridges with Ms. Go today.

00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:45.154
I have no idea what kind of crap
I'll have to deal with now.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.281
Stop. Let's just go.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.034
I was awesome back in there.

00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:51.994
Don't you want to know?

00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:55.623
I'd rather know if you need
to throw up or pass out.

00:47:58.084 --> 00:47:59.126
I'll just go.

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.138
Get me everything on Lee Daeum.

00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:13.682
Hire a private eye, get a reporter on her,
I don't care.

00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:16.936
Get any information on her
so we can get her to join us.

00:48:24.443 --> 00:48:26.904
LEE DAEUM

00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:30.157
Why aren't you answering?

00:48:43.045 --> 00:48:44.713
What are you doing?

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.258
Welcome back.

00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:49.677
Are you going to keep breaking promises?

00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.973
I only broke half the promise.

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.100
I didn't touch anything.

00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:58.853
I just wiped off the dust.
You know how hard that was?

00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:07.862
Did anyone ask you to clean?

00:49:08.737 --> 00:49:11.282
And why didn't you pick up your phone?
I was worried.

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:15.369
Must've missed it while I was cleaning.

00:49:16.162 --> 00:49:17.621
Should I mess it all up again, then?

00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.749
A patient breathing in dust sounds great.

00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:23.711
You're only a patient when it suits you.

00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:28.549
TIME TO EAT

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:29.842
I have to eat.

00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:30.968
What did you have for lunch?

00:49:31.051 --> 00:49:33.137
I ate at Grandma's Table.
It was delicious.

00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:35.055
Hmm.

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:38.309
Good to hear.
Hand me your phone, unlocked.

00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:46.775
ALARM

00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:53.574
What are you doing?

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:56.076
7:00 A.M.

00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:58.579
I need to know this too.

00:49:58.662 --> 00:49:59.997
Just double-checking.

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.795
ALARM

00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:09.089
Here you go.

00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:11.091
Let's go eat.

00:50:11.717 --> 00:50:12.885
Ah.

00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:15.471
Are you okay with Grandma's Table again?

00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:17.640
Yes, I can eat there
every day of the week.

00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:18.933
Even a month.

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.606
GRANDMA'S TABLE

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.950
Go back to your friend's after we eat.

00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:37.117
I guess I should.

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.120
Dig in.

00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:48.170
Can I stay?

00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:51.257
No.

00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:54.093
Okay.

00:50:58.013 --> 00:51:00.224
I'm heading to Gangwon-do
after I drop you off.

00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:03.519
Are you going on a trip?

00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:04.853
A trip? I wish.

00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:07.606
It's for location scouting.

00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.277
Can't you take me too?

00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:13.612
Why?

00:51:13.696 --> 00:51:15.447
Gyuwon lives in Gangwon-do.

00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:17.366
I want to get to know her better.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.663
You'll take me, right?

00:51:25.165 --> 00:51:26.166
No.

00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:31.797
I figured you'd say no.

00:51:32.381 --> 00:51:34.341
Man, I'm getting shut down a lot today.

00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:40.139
Because you keep asking for things
I have to shut down.

00:51:40.848 --> 00:51:43.601
Daeum, let me ask you again.

00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:48.272
If you want to do this movie,
can you be a bit smarter about it?

00:51:50.232 --> 00:51:52.359
Have you forgotten what you are?

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.698
You're not just an ordinary actress.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:01.952
Don't you forget that.

00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:18.719

"High fever."

00:52:49.625 --> 00:52:52.211
Cut! Okay, that's good.

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:55.464
"Going without food may cause seizures."

00:52:56.548 --> 00:52:58.550
<i>That again. What is it?</i>

00:52:58.634 --> 00:53:00.886
What's it for? Why set one just to eat?

00:53:00.969 --> 00:53:04.765
The thing is, my body can't
absorb nutrients like most people's,

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:07.768
<i>so I need to eat a lot, often,</i>
<i>and at regular times</i>

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.561
<i>to get more nutrients.</i>

00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:11.563
If I go too long without food,

00:53:11.647 --> 00:53:13.399
I could go into shock,

00:53:13.482 --> 00:53:15.818
or if it's bad enough, I could die.

00:53:24.993 --> 00:53:27.454
HYLENOL

00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:50.602
Yes, here it is!

00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:52.312
Looks great.

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:09.747
RESTRICTED AREA

00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:15.669
<i>When you're in the hospital long enough,</i>

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:18.005
<i>there are days that feel unbearable.</i>

00:54:19.423 --> 00:54:21.008
This is just a glass window,

00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:24.178
but life could be so different beyond it.

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:44.781
Filming from in here would be nice.

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:46.950
What do you think?

00:54:47.034 --> 00:54:48.952
- I like it.
- Got it.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.831
Sir, the director would like to film
from inside here.

00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:54.541
You're not allowed in that area.

00:54:55.459 --> 00:54:56.627
Mr. Lee.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:59.588
He says we can't
because that's a restricted area.

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:05.928
Not here, then.

00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:20.609
Mr. Lee,

00:55:20.692 --> 00:55:22.152
did you put your phone on silent?

00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:26.198
YU HONG: COULD YOU CALL ME,
MR. LEE? - MISSED CALLS

00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:28.033
My alarms kept going off.

00:55:28.116 --> 00:55:30.494
Please turn it on and pick up my calls.

00:55:31.286 --> 00:55:32.538
The key to the bookstore.

00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:35.165
We're going out for a drink,

00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:36.792
but I'm guessing you can't go?

00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:38.210
I have some work to do.

00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:40.128
Need to check out the bookstore too.

00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:42.005
It's nighttime. Can't you go tomorrow?

00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:44.258
We film at night too.

00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:48.595
Hmm? I'll go look on my own.

00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:50.556
Go on, but don't drink too much.

00:55:50.639 --> 00:55:51.807
BOOK

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:09.283
Welcome! This is Lee Gyuwon's bookstore.

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:12.244
Is there a book you're looking for?

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.413
Ms. Lee Daeum.

00:56:15.622 --> 00:56:16.623
What are you doing here?

00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:20.794
How did you get here?

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.504
I got here by car.

00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:30.679
- Mmm!
- I thought you were Mr. Lee's friend.

00:56:30.762 --> 00:56:32.472
Are you sure you can abandon him
and be here?

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:34.933
He'll manage on his own.

00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:42.858
Do you like somaek?

00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:44.276
Of course I do.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.030
This is called Gen MZ's somaek.

00:56:51.366 --> 00:56:53.744
- Here. Let's have a glass.
- Sure.

00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:57.414
Why are you here, though?

00:56:58.123 --> 00:57:00.459
Actors don't usually come
for location scouting.

00:57:01.043 --> 00:57:02.044
Well,

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:04.671
the shoot's coming up soon,

00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:07.466
and I heard
checking out the location in advance

00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:09.509
helps actors get into character.

00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:15.807
Says who?

00:57:16.767 --> 00:57:18.977
Well, I brought all my meds.

00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:22.105
I stopped by the hospital
to get my checkup results

00:57:22.189 --> 00:57:24.024
and got the all-clear from my doctor.

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:28.779
It's not like I'm running a marathon
or doing anything strenuous here.

00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:32.866
I even stuck on a bunch of heat packs
so I wouldn't catch a cold.

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:34.284
So if I still get sick?

00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:36.536
Then I don't deserve to be in this film.

00:57:38.747 --> 00:57:40.374
At least you came prepared.

00:57:43.168 --> 00:57:46.088
I really wanted to come here
at least once before the shoot.

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:53.011
Gyuwon's lived her whole life
in this neighborhood, right?

00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:56.348
Mmm.

00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:59.559
I thought seeing her bookstore in person

00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:03.105
would help me understand
her loneliness and her sense of isolation.

00:58:06.733 --> 00:58:09.027
I thought I'd be able
to feel these things better.

00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:11.780
For Gyuwon, the bookstore.

00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:13.407
For me, the hospital.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.909
For Gyuwon, there's Hyunsang.

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.327
For me…

00:58:24.626 --> 00:58:27.254
Gyuwon and I are very much alike.

00:58:28.422 --> 00:58:30.882
The overwhelming loneliness I felt…

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.219
and the sudden ray of hope
that came to me.

00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:59.369
I'm not sure if it would be right for me
to call that love,

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.748
so I came here to find answers.

00:59:03.457 --> 00:59:05.417
Since you keep telling me it's not.

00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:09.838
Since you came all this way,

00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:12.257
do you want to go inside?

00:59:14.593 --> 00:59:17.596
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:59:18.722 --> 00:59:19.723
<i>Hmm.</i>

00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:21.641
Hmm?

00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:24.144
So Mr. Lee's the one who said that.

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.062
Exactly.

00:59:26.688 --> 00:59:29.775
I didn't even ask,
and he kept ranting on and on.

00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:32.944
As a manager,

00:59:33.028 --> 00:59:34.613
if something helps my actress,

00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:36.490
it's not like

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.658
I can't come here, you know?

00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:47.042
Oh.

00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:50.212
But I'm glad I came.

00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:52.214
I got to see you.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:01.139
I need a smoke.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.016
- I have one.
- Where's the restroom?

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:08.647
Just drink this!

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.106
Oh? Okay.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.864
What the…

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.335
It's so dark in here.

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.671
Uh, wait here for a minute.

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.347
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.854
The art team did a great job.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:57.904
It's beautiful.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.908
Mmm.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:05.912
I'm jealous of Gyuwon.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.124
No, wait. I'm not, since I am Gyuwon.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:12.961
Take a seat.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.011
It's funny, isn't it?

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:24.014
I don't think you told my manager,

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.684
so how did he know to bring me here?

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.354
Are you warm?

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.273
I'm just fine.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:35.650
I'm a bit cold.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:45.118
Sometimes,
people say one thing and do another.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.329
So what do you think?

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.416
Do you feel something,
seeing where Gyuwon lives?

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:52.959
Hmm…

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.695
EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY KNOWS.
THAT IT'S LOVE.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:23.365
What's with this sappy melodrama?

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.201
It came to me
while I was reading the script.

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:30.538
And…

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.874
I haven't been able to shake it.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.339
The scene where Hyunsang kisses Gyuwon.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.509
Can't Gyuwon kiss him first instead?

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:44.469
Why?

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.179
I realized, now that I've tried it,

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:50.016
that Gyuwon and Hyunsang
wouldn't just kiss on a whim.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:52.310
They kiss because they know.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.354
Because they know?

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.191
Their feelings are just impulsive
at that point.

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.693
It's only a week since they've met.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:00.860
It's not love.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.364
But Gyuwon wants him to know.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.784
She's telling this man,

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:10.537
who doesn't believe in love or hope

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.248
and thinks they're just useless…

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.003
"Look.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:19.629
Don't you feel it too?

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:22.382
It's already begun."

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:33.143
One week is…

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:34.728
I CAN GET HEALTHY IN A WEEK TOO

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.771
…more than enough time to fall in love.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.692
One week…

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.032
is more than enough time

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.035
to destroy love as well.

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:13.224
Actually…

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.936
I have one more secret.

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:20.315
A secret?

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.650
The first time I met you

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.445
wasn't at the hospital.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.115
I know. It was at the convenience store.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.367
We saw each other.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:35.163
It was way before that.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:41.252
Five years ago,

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:45.840
I passed the first round of auditions
for your movie,

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:48.426
<i>The Lonely People</i>.

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:50.845
The one Seoyoung got.

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:56.810
You probably don't remember me,

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.561
since there were so many people.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.064
I didn't even make the second round.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:04.192
But I still remembered…

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:06.194
your name,

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.948
Lee Jeha.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:15.286
So,

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.747
when I saw your name on the proposal

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.291
on Dr. Minseok's desk,

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:23.378
my heart started pounding.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.381
So I planned it all.

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:29.717
I deliberately came looking for you.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:34.305
I don't even know where I got the courage.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.059
Funny, right?

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.144
Me, of all people?

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:40.854
What was I planning?

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:43.731
When I can't even do anything…

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:45.984
When I'm going to die soon…

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:01.541
Who says you can't do anything?

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.381
I told you,
you're someone who can do everything.

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.142
It's a pretty lame secret.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.647
Do you want me
to tell you a bigger one, then?

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:39.204
Is it weird if someone like me…

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.044
likes someone like you?

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:59.724

<i>going on between Mr. Lee and Daeum, right?</i>

<i>Is it you that likes her,</i>
<i>or her that likes you?</i>

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:11.379
I'm very interested in Daeum,

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:12.797
so I wanted some information.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.048
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:16.634
Why drop an article like that
out of nowhere?

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:18.594
Has your face always been this pale?

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:22.098
This hospital is actually…

01:08:27.061 --> 01:08:28.855
I'll personally make sure

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:31.899
Daeum is pulled from the film.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:33.860
Then what about your film?

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.571
Isn't the movie
what's most important to you?

01:08:37.405 --> 01:08:39.574
Yes. Even if I have to give up this movie…

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:45.121
I'll return Daeum to this hospital.
