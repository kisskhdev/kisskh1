《S LINE》 (The red line between those
who have had a sexual relationship)

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.770
Uncle, wake up.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.740
Uncle, time to get up.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.116
Uncle.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.700
What are you doing.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.717
Kang Sun-ah

00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:05.140
I don't have any
extravagant wishes in this life.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.229
The only thing I want is
freedom, an unrestrained life.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.910
But what I want to escape from

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.960
has ultimately become a life challenge

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.430
(glasses)

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.650
When did they…

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.320
Impressive.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.776
Hey, come over here.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.777
What is it.

00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:11.970
Come here.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.890
Lower your head.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.360
Why.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.000
What is it.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.826
When did you start being with your wife.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.110
In college.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.296
Before that, no girlfriend?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.776
Yes, I did.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.046
Dated a few people.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.130
One.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.646
Wow, you really are from
a different world than me.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.240
Why suddenly like this.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.050
Why are you suddenly wearing glasses.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.150
Are you trying to see things
from the suspect's perspective.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.456
They don't suit you at all

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.490
I knew that too.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.970
Do you have something to discuss?

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.700
Um... I...

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.056
Ah, excuse me, are you a
student at Ark High School?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.877
Yes.

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.850
Oh, come with me.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.100
You follow me first.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.650
Isn't this reckless for a detective?

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.176
You need to get an arrest warrant.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.010
What nonsense, I'm not arresting you

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.376
I just want you to come with
me to visit a friend in the hospital.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.456
Because I need to confirm something.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.620
Who's my friend?

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.730
What do you want to confirm?

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.070
Let's go in and see.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.580
Hey -Wait here for a moment.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.690
Now that we've seen it, can we leave?

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.410
Hold on.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.446
Do you know if Sana has another boyfriend?

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.630
A boyfriend?

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.550
Are you talking about
Kang Sana's boyfriend?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.966
I don't know if she has a boyfriend, but she
seems to have someone she really dislikes.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.490
Ah, could it be Detective?

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.186
Stop joking around, explain clearly.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.580
She frequently says.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.670
One day I'll definitely
kill that demon-like guy.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.610
She seems to hate him
more than Kim Hye-young.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.396
(Gyeongjin) Next week is
Hyun-hyeop's birthday, right?

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.580
(Jun-seon) When?

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.686
November 1st.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.310
(Kyung Jin) Let's have a birthday party.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.996
I don't like it.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.020
(Kyung Jin) Why not?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.370
I've never had a birthday party.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.286
Sorry, it's not up to you.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.500
Hahaha -Haha.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.620
(Yoo Joon Seon) Before meeting
everyone, can I meet you alone first?

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.190
(Number not shown You are sincerely invited
to the birthday party on November 1st)

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.350
(Number not shown I can see the world you see Come to Ark High School
You are sincerely invited to the birthday party on November 1st)

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.780
Room of vigilance.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.706
What do you think of this
lipstick? I just bought it.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.076
It's so ordinary -Are you
saying it's really ordinary?

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.256
- Wipe it off -Why should I wipe it off?
- It's only you...

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.730
Oh, Ji Na is here.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.076
Hey, no practice today either?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.780
Rare to see you in class.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.896
Nothing much...

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.330
Crazy woman, why are you pretending?

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.010
I don't know.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.550
- What are you doing?
- Why like this?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.140
Should I try being a celebrity too?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.940
You can't -Why can't I?

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.500
Brother.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.676
It seems there was a minor
sexual assault incident.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.216
Just let So Min go.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.370
You should go in with her.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.140
Who is it?

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:59.409
A week ago, I went to a friend's
house and drank with him.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.510
He's a former idol trainee I
used to know. We're very close.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.110
We drank together.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.356
I temporarily lost consciousness.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.090
When I came to.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.630
I found my underwear was inside out.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.320
Where's the brother you were with?

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.690
He messaged me saying he left first.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.929
May I ask... did you have any
sexual experience before that?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.346
No.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.626
Why would she lie?

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.420
What?

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.730
It's nothing.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.130
Tomorrow, let's first visit
the brother she mentioned.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.830
Hurry up.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.307
Let's go together - Hurry.

00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:07.776
Kids these days, honestly

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.660
I wasn't like that in high school.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.440
What are you talking
about, mumbling to yourself?

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.206
I'm tired of school

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.366
I've graduated long ago, yet I'm
still hanging around the campus.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.300
Exactly, there seem to be a
lot of incidents at school lately.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.830
Hello, detective.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.710
Hello.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.580
Is she single since birth?

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.780
Ah, celibate before marriage?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.270
Great to see you again - Yeah.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.960
But... that might not be a good thing.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.936
How's Sanaa doing?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.120
Ah... she's still in the hospital.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.980
I see... is it okay for
classmates to visit her now?

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.470
It's still a bit.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.000
I see...

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.840
But you're wearing glasses.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.460
They suit you well.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.540
How do they suit me?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.316
Your ears are turning red.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.160
You know Xu Han-yu from class 2-7, right?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.310
Han-yu... I know him.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.626
Xu Han-yu, what's your relationship
with Yin Jina from class 1-4?

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.140
She's just a friend I know.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.346
We were idol trainees together before.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:57.410
On the night of September 20th, you drank
together at your serviced apartment, right?

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.626
Yes - What about your parents?

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.846
They're abroad

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.040
I came back to be a
singer and live alone now.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.377
You're in high school.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.360
Is it okay to drink like this?

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.640
Why are you so confident?

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.316
Sorry, detective

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.410
I have too much study pressure.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.366
You're here as a suspected sex offender.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.070
Do you understand?

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.380
Did Yin Jina say that?

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.850
I didn't sleep with her.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.100
I don't particularly want to sleep with her.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.300
Kids these days are really scary.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.236
They even have a refined appearance.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.210
Investigating will uncover
something eventually.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.960
You're seeing right through me.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.630
I was planning to say it first.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.216
Please give me.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.330
Please give me.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.350
This is evidence for the
case. I can't just give it to you.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.666
No, can evidence be worn
around like this casually?

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.476
I at least need to test what it's for, right?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.260
No, it should be sent to a
forensic team or something.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.150
Yes, that's correct.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.240
But the moment I put on these glasses,

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.516
Wow... everything you
said turned out to be true.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.700
I got goosebumps all over.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.426
How lucky is that!

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.276
Now I believe you.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.506
You believe me too.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.156
I don't believe you.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.426
Throw those glasses away immediately.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.690
Calm down, why react like this?

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.520
Detective.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.690
Didn't seeing Seon-Ah make it clear to you?

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.050
And that man upstairs...

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.136
Those glasses.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.920
You said you found
them at the scene, right?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.690
Isn't it clear now?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.686
Every time something happens,
it's related to the glasses.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.116
Keeping them is dangerous.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.750
Wow, you're really persuasive.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.776
That's why I should try wearing them!

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.757
And how are glasses dangerous...

00:13:20.781 --> 00:13:22.716
It's not the glasses being dangerous.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.946
It's not knowing what the
glasses might do to you.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.400
What happened?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.520
Hyuk, what's wrong?

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.170
Nothing much, she lives nearby.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.540
We did a great job...
It's really special, right?

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.916
Afterwards...

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.970
Do you have time to have dinner with me?

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:57.710
What?

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.130
Never mind, I'll contact you later.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.426
Hello, you both arrived early.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.000
Oh, please have a seat...

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.466
Yin Zhi Na.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.436
Initially, I personally brought her in.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.436
But she never intended to work hard.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.566
So,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.516
I told her if she doesn't
want to do it, then don't.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.096
After all, I'm not that type of person

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.270
who forces others.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.060
What kind of person is Yin Zhi Na usually?

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.996
Although saying this

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.240
is a bit of a slap in my own face,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.696
honestly, she's not very talented.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.576
Without talent, you at
least need to work hard.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.426
But she's not determined enough.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.016
And she loves to have fun too much.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.186
Often, she encourages other
trainees to drink alcohol together

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.866
and meet up with guys.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.737
Wow.

00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:26.420
I mean, is there anything she can do then?

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.230
We can't rule out the possibility
that she's making false accusations.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.060
We can't draw a conclusion yet.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.180
This is a real headache, I hate
these kinds of cases the most.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.326
What kind of cases are these?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.070
It's just everyone saying different things.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.336
Plus, both of them are minors.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.210
It's a sensitive case, and
we can't interrogate recklessly.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.490
Isn't there a lie detector
that's 100% accurate?

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.300
Seriously.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.040
This doesn't make any sense.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.310
What?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.630
Nothing.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.960
Bro, you wouldn't...

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.556
Like that teacher of
Sanah's class, would you?

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.580
What?

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.160
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.340
If not, then forget it.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.210
She's a bit annoying.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.380
Keeps pestering me to meet.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.950
I'm about to enter senior year.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.060
No longer a trainee.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.430
Can I see your messages?

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.890
Sure.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.250
(Jina)(Bro, I'm really tired today,
can I come to your place?) (Now?)

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.916
(Jina)(Yeah, are you
busy?) (A little bit…?)

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.319
(Jina)(I'll just stay for a short while, okay? I'm feeling really
down, wah wah) (You're coming now? Want a drink?) (Jina)(Yeah!!)

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.555
You deleted all the messages.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.656
The clothes you wore on the day of the
incident, and the blood-stained underwear.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.356
You washed them all.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.790
Reported it a week after it happened.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.089
Didn't you think.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.020
That this might be very
disadvantageous for you?

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.926
I already said, I didn't
want to believe it was real.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.650
You might accidentally be
accused of making false accusations.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.740
Detective.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.220
I washed Zina's clothes.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.810
It's not Zina's fault.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.400
(Bro, there's nothing special.
(I'm letting Hanyu go now.)

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.930
Please wait a moment.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.940
Yoon Zina, classmate.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.420
I'll ask one last time.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.050
Did you really have
forced sexual relations...

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.200
Wrong.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.000
Did you and Seo Hanyu really
have a sexual relationship?

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.650
This doesn't need to go to the prosecutor.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.370
What?

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.780
Hey, sunglasses.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.490
Why didn't you call me that today?

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.720
When did I ever call you that?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.180
By the way.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.860
This is for you.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.220
It might not really count as a gift.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.830
I've looked into your case.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.796
Your parents ended up like that.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.120
It's not your fault.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.640
I was afraid you might think that way.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.820
So that's what she looks like.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.730
Different from the face I remembered.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.810
Do you want to find your mom?

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.220
Seon-a told me.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.510
If she were alive, why
wouldn't she come see me?

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.160
Like you said, these glasses.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.056
They might be very dangerous.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.776
But I believe they can
definitely help some people.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.960
Just like you saved the girl in room 204.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.120
So, detective, who are
you trying to save now?

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.430
Oh, right.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.440
There's a student named
Yoon Ji-na in your class, correct?

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.950
Yes.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.400
I heard she reported
being sexually assaulted.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.700
That's confirmed to be no longer suspect.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.460
Using this.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.496
There is no S-line between them.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.006
Yoon Ji-na clearly stated
she had no sexual experience.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.130
Yet, she has 4 S-lines on her head.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.676
She was arrogant before, claiming
she wanted to become an idol.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.786
- Serves her right.
- Serves her right.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.350
What Yoon Ji-na said.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.780
It might be true.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.460
A week ago, she had no S-lines.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.117
Hey.

00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:14.556
Has Yoon Ji-na's case been handed over?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.726
No, I'm still organizing it.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.676
- Don't hand it over yet.
- What?

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.740
We need to investigate it
again from the beginning.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.580
Bro, isn't this risky...

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.180
Seo Han-yoo.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.900
We're the police. Are you home?

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.080
Seo Han-yoo.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.520
- You...
- Detective, hello.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.810
May we come in and sit for a moment?

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.620
Sure, please come in.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.856
Wow.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.420
Your house is incredibly tidy.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.050
Yeah, I'm a bit of a neat freak.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.450
So...

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.590
Was she drinking here?

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.716
She sat here drinking for a while.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.010
Later, she passed out.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.350
I moved her to the bed.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.260
So...

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.130
Are there any empty bottles from then?

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.720
No, because I don't keep empty bottles.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.830
Hey guys.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.450
What?

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.590
I have to leave very
early tomorrow morning.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.030
Can I go to sleep now?

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.400
(Business Closed)

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.966
I went back just in case.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.370
Found glasses in the
bathtub at the crime scene.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.990
What if these glasses were
deliberately placed for you to find?

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.700
That's impossible.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.736
How could they know
I'd return to the scene?

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.840
Nothing makes sense right now.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.810
I can see the S-line.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.160
And so can these glasses.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.340
Someone must have put the
glasses at the Megastar Inn.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.140
Who is that person?

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.010
- What are you doing here?
- I was just...

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.966
Passing by, saw you ahead.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.056
Thought something might have happened.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:51.927
Followed to check it out.

00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:53.330
Then near here, you disappeared.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.840
And didn't answer my calls.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:57.730
Not answering my calls either.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.040
But...

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.730
Why did you come back here again?

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.190
I left something behind
while I was working.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.076
Aren't you scared?

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.460
I find it a bit eerie.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.250
Well.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.956
I mentioned I could
see strange things, right?

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.980
Yeah.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.750
Now, on your head...

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.260
Don't say it.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.400
If I had an S line...

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.220
Being with you...

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880
What?

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.570
Even if I see strange
things, it doesn't matter.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.900
Why are you doing hard
work so early in the morning?

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.630
This one feels nice.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.020
Found it.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.460
Okay, got it. You go on with your work.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.110
How long did National
Forensics say it would take?

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.610
If it's quick, it'll be out tomorrow.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.930
Brother, but how did you
think of looking for the blanket?

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.860
That bed sheet...

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.790
The color of the bed
sheet kept bothering me.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.720
It doesn't match his place at all.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.176
A perfectly good blanket...

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.216
It wasn't thrown in the trash.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.510
It was specially taken to
the old clothes recycling bin.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.630
There must be something fishy about this.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.470
But...

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.710
It doesn't make any sense at all.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.230
Humans can develop biases
from interacting with others.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.140
Seo Han-yoo.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:32.980
Come out.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.390
Hurry and come out.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.560
Aren't you going to feed me?

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.010
I'm really hungry.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.890
Come on, I'll ask you again.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.640
Why did you throw away the sheets?

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.030
Because I'm a germaphobe.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.356
I can't sleep on sheets
someone else has used

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.170
I think I've said it five times already.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.286
Then how do you explain
Yoon Ji-na's blood on them?

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.486
I don't know.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.650
Maybe she had a nosebleed while sleeping.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.780
Or she got her period.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.340
Han-yoo.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.660
I know…

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.266
You didn't do anything

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.836
I totally believe you.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.900
Want to know why?

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.956
Guys like us.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.470
Even if we stay quiet,
girls won't leave us alone.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.700
Didn't Yoon Ji-na try
to win you over first?

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.450
Clearly, you weren't interested in her.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.840
To be honest…

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.840
She's not my type at all.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.500
Even though everyone says she's pretty.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.446
Anyway…she kept insisting to come over.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.816
So I let her come.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.346
And finished the remaining
foreign liquor at home

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.317
I poured some out for her to drink.

00:32:38.341 --> 00:32:39.860
She drank it all by herself.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.550
You have some imported liquor at home.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.540
What brand is it?

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.570
I like whiskey too.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.090
Glenfiddich.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.930
And then?

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.070
After she drank it all.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.320
She got drunk and went crazy,
saying she didn't want to go home.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.060
She wanted to keep drinking.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.456
So I bought her a bottle of
beer at the convenience store.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.150
She passed out immediately.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.960
Was it because of mixing drinks?

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.466
How can you buy alcohol
at the convenience store?

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.620
That store doesn't check IDs.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.910
You guys should verify.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.500
Glenfiddich?

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:31.390
Brother.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.170
The only clear footage from this business
apartment is from the parking lot camera.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.580
Because there are many units here
and a lot of people coming and going.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.756
The time Yoon Ji-na entered.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.696
The time Seo Han-yoo returned
from the convenience store.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.236
And the time he left in the morning.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.700
They all match up.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.926
How long was he gone buying beer?

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.960
About 5 to 10 minutes.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:34:00.716
If someone entered
the room during that time.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.100
It would create an S line.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:09.330
That means she was already
unconscious before drinking the beer.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.150
What line.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:14.870
Nothing.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.719
Hey, pause for a moment.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.500
When did these guys go in?

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:28.010
(Business Apartment
Convenience Store Monitor)

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.159
About an hour ago.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.010
Hmm, here.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.316
Isn't there a monitor at the back
door of the business apartment?

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.870
No, there isn't.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.465
Rewind and check again.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.390
From six to seven.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.140
From four to five

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.280
123…

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.730
These bastards.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.030
Is she Jina?

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.060
Keep it with you.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.187
Do you have a cigarette?

00:35:38.211 --> 00:35:39.730
No.

(Sunglasses)

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.576
Damn it, what a waste of time.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.236
Get me a lawyer.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.650
What are you doing - Hey.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.070
Detective, can you please let me go home?

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.786
I really didn't do anything.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.940
Please let me go home, okay?

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.900
My mom is really going to kill me.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.720
Please.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.040
Alright, I'll take you home, let's go.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.040
Detective.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.156
This is the opposite
direction from my house.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.710
Hmm, I know.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.870
Where are we going?

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.526
Hey, what do you think of this car?

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.010
It feels pretty comfortable, right?

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.270
Can you just tell me
where we're going? Please?

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:39.390
Why is the red light taking so long?

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.520
Why did we come here?

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.940
Seems like you know where we are.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.750
Detective Wu, let's get out of the car.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.670
What are we having for
dinner? Want to drink some soju?

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.010
Bro.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.516
We don't have much time.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.670
Seo Hanyu is about to be released.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.400
And we have no reason
to hold him any longer.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.220
It's good you're still talking.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.700
But your expression
should be a bit fiercer.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.540
Why?

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.820
Isn't it obvious?

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:46.406
He's about to wet his pants.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:50.056
We need to look as serious as possible.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.520
Then just watch how things play out.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.356
In my opinion.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.900
Ten minutes should be enough.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.496
- Fan Zhou, come out for a moment.
- What?

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.450
Come out for a moment.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.326
Where are we going?

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.260
Just up ahead, it won't take long.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.030
Where are we going?

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.676
You really can't let me go home?

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.106
No, we have to take a look
at the crime scene together.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.140
I'll return to the police
station later... Damn it.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.920
That guy just blew himself up.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.960
Damn brat.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.330
He runs super fast, doesn't he?

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.550
Yeah.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.110
Officer - Yes

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:51.250
I really want to go home

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.036
I'll take you home.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.900
But first, we need to
go to the police station.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.820
Why? What about the others?

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.440
I already sent them home.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.380
Why?

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.136
Because they seem fine.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.526
What about me?

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.230
Why won't you let me go home?

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.620
You...

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.910
Seem to have some issues.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.596
No...

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.220
This isn't right.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.740
Honestly.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.010
This isn't right.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.000
Damn it.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.350
You'll get hurt like this, calm down.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:49.930
Officer.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.860
If I tell the truth, I won't
be taken away, right?

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:58.930
Well.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.180
Depends on what you say.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.930
I did it.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.530
But not by myself.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.880
Damn, I feel so wronged.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.086
It was all planned by Han Yu.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.966
I keep saying how pretty
Yoon Ji-na is all day.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.236
That day, they suddenly called me.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.406
They asked how much I'd pay them if
they helped me sleep with Yoon Ji-na.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.820
I just thought having a drink
with her would be nice and went.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.066
But Han Yu drugged
Ji-na, making her pass out.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.096
Officer.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.510
It was all orchestrated by Han Yu.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.256
I didn't do it alone; We all did it together.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.796
Can... can you just let me off this time?

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.596
It was all Han Yu's doing.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.050
I just... went along
because my friends said to.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:51.530
That pervert Han Yu
watched the whole thing.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.790
Is this yours?

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.676
- What's that?
- It was found in your room, you know.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.300
I clearly put it in the fire hydrant,
what are you talking about…

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.620
Did you use this on Yoon Ji-na?

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.110
Do you have evidence?

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.440
I only kept it around because
I thought it was amusing.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.276
Well, let's see if the
court finds it amusing too.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.716
They all confessed.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.590
There's a total of four witnesses.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.340
The rapist isn't me.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.080
It's those guys, got it?

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.250
Yeah, and you're the mastermind, right?

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.740
You scumbag.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.920
- Officer.
- Yes.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.650
Will they be punished?

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.670
We've done everything we can.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.210
The court will make their own judgment.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.380
It would be best if the judge
could try on these glasses.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.700
Even with the glasses on,

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.020
you might not see the truth, right?

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:35.570
Exactly.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.440
If I were like you with lots of S lines,

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:51.620
I guess I wouldn't feel a thing inside.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.930
Are you mocking me again?

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.400
Can you walk on your
own after getting out here?

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.910
I have to rush somewhere.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:13.940
Oh... alright.

(Incheon City Elderly

00:44:37.221 --> 00:44:39.716
When did he disappear?

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.166
Why does this always happen?

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.746
Is he really not inside the hospital?

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.096
We... um...

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.226
Last time, we found him on the roof.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.867
And I was the one who found him.

00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:49.920
Could you come in and take a look?

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.986
It's the first time we've
seen this person too.

No idea how she got in.

real identity from Ark High School.

Don't touch her, damn it.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.626
You...

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:01.070
What did you do to Suna.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.836
Speak up.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.276
Damn it, I told you to talk.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.500
Ji-uk...

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:27.210
Damn it.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.980
What about Suna.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.260
What do you expect her to do.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.060
You... to Suna.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:01.970
Detective...

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.560
Please help me.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.190
(Lee Soo-hyuk)

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:18.200
(Arin)

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:22.280
(And Lee Da-hee)

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:32.580
I have a favor to ask you.

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:36.210
If you're not willing, you can refuse.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.420
Do you like me.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.510
I just feel like.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.740
If I'm going to be with someone,
I hope that person can be you.

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:02.246
(Who are you talking to on the phone? Are you ignoring me? Do you think
calling the police will make this video disappear? You're done for)

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:03.280
This...

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.070
Seems like you just dropped it.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.030
Detective...

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.620
Please help me.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.116
I looked up your homeroom teacher's identity
and found that this person doesn't exist

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.356
Lee Kyu-jin doesn't exist at all.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:22.750
You know what the
line above signifies, right.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:27.336
If you wait a little longer, the entire
world will soon be covered in bright red.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.560
