This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.760
Why would you even try now?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.200
You’re ten years too late.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
But still… you’re my son!

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.680
How much does Petchsak Academy owe you?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.920
I’ll pay the debt for them.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.840
I know who drugged you.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000
I’m sorry, Coach.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520
Sorry I’m late.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.200
I got caught up dealing with some new product stuff, Sia Thep.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.560
Haha!

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.760
Come on in.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
It's those two guys?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.480
Welcome, fighters from Petchsak Academy to my ring.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760
Your fight ring?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.080
Boss.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.000
Hmm?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.800
Shall we take them now, boss?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.560
Yeah.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.560
Boss?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Sia Thep, is it?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.720
Oh.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.040
How’s your sister doing?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.240
How’s the heart I got for her?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.320
So it was you… You were using me this whole time.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.920
You bastard!

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.600
Hey!
Don’t!

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.040
Ait!
Calm down.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.760
Back off!
Calm down.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.560
Help!

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.480
Help me!

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.520
Help!

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.720
Please help me!

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.080
Help!

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.240
Please get me out of here!

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.720
Help!

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720
Please, help me!

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720
Please!

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.600
Help me!

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.040
Wait!

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.440
Muay’s thug?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.360
Please get me out of here!

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.160
Help me!

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.160
Please help me!

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.800
Please help!

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.640
Help!

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.640
Hey!
Hey!

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.040
Keen!

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.680
Please help me!

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680
Keen, watch out!

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.440
Keen!

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.960
(Scream!)

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.000
A good underling must take responsibility for their boss.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.120
I apologize to everyone for him being so rude.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.800
Your underling?

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.840
Muay stole money from me.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.720
So her guy has to work off her debt.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.880
That means I can do whatever I want to with him.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.640
Please don’t hurt me, let me go.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.160
Let me go.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.640
Or just kill me already.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.520
Alright then. Patch him up. When he recovers, throw him in the ring.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.760
My fighters, I only allow them to die in the ring.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.000
It’s almost time.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.560
Everyone, this way. Please.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.160
Go.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.960
This way, please. Go.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.560
Typhoon…

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.680
Welcome to my very own, The Ring Rage.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.440
The Ring Rage

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760
(Keen, I’m here)

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Where are you?)

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.880
Why aren’t you answering?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.360
(Sorry, the number you’ve dialed cannot be connected)

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.240
Hello?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.480
So, why did you bring us here?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.640
Well, since Petchsak Academy now belongs to me,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.480
you’re basically my employees.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:55.040
And why do you think I'd bring fighters here?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.400
Thun!

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.320
Hey!

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.800
Back off, asshole!

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.080
Easy, easy.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.120
Please be gentle with my fighter.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.080
I’ve had my eye on this one for a long time.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.200
Very happy to finally get you.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.600
Looks like the match is already decided.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.280
Hey!

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.600
That’s enough.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.120
The winner is Typhoon Roaring Thunder!

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240
Ha ha!

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.240
Well done.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.560
This Friday, I’m putting you in the Heaven’s Arena match.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.040
Give the winner his prize.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.840
Whoa!

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080
Awesome.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.640
Take it all.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.200
Great.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.320
As for the loser…

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.640
Can I have another chance?

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.200
I’ll do better next time, I promise.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.440
You know I’m a man who gives people chances.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.080
I give chances to everyone.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.760
Except traitors.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:42.440
Police Captain Thewakit Damrongthamsakul,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:48.880
from the Central Investigation Bureau.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.000
You think I’m that stupid, huh?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.880
I’m sorry, boss.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.120
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:18.680
Let me introduce you to Jonathan, the punishment I reserve for traitors.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.520
Please… Give me another chance.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.920
I’m sorry.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.640
Please, help me.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.680
Help me, please!

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
Take his body out.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.080
Tsk.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.160
But your father was mauled by a big dog.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.000
The body might not be very pleasant to look at.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320
You killed my dad!

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.800
Hey!
Keen!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.120
You killed my dad!

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.520
Why’d you kill my dad?!

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.520
Let go of me!

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.560
You got a death wish, huh?

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.680
Yeah~

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.080
Keen!

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.280
Step back!

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.680
Don’t hurt Keen!

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.600
I’m begging you.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.840
Don’t hurt Keen.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.800
Take everyone out, except these two.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.960
All of you, out.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.880
You, come here.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.440
Keen!

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.000
Go.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.080
Keen!

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.720
Come on.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.160
What the hell are you staring at?

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.520
Hey.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.520
I’ll take it from here.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Damn bastard. Thinks he’s so cool, huh?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Get up slowly.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.920
So, how does it feel...

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.800
To be nothing but a pawn on my chessboard?

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.800
What the hell are you talking about?

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.640
You seriously didn’t realize it?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.520
That I’ve been pulling your strings all along?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.000
Pulling what strings?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.720
Since when?

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:13.920
Truth is, your dad didn’t have any debt before he died.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.800
"Please, I’m begging you. My kid’s about to graduate."

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.200
"I really need the money."

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.360
Well done.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.360
Hello, it’s done now, boss.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.120
"Please, I’m begging you. My kid’s about to graduate."

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.240
"I really need the money."

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.560
So I sent guys to beat you up,

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.480
forced you into a corner where you needed cash,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.560
so you’d have no choice but to join Petchsak Academy.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.520
Even that fight fixer who egged Mawin into gambling till he lost everything, he’s my guy.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.520
If you’re that confident, good.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.680
I’ll double down and crush you.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.440
Damn it, that’s my money, you bastard!

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.560
You were betting on Sia Thep’s table, weren’t you?

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.400
No need to be so stressed.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.960
Sia Thep’s a kind man.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:22.440
The worm I raised, Ait, went and manipulated you until you crawled your way to me.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.560
Keen, do you know MP Phuwish?

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.760
Why don’t you try contacting him for support?

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.320
I’m here to speak with MP Phuwish.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.000
Oh, and another thing, as you already know…

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.160
He’s also the one who drugged your boyfriend for me.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.440
You ready to follow through with the plan, Ait?

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.240
But... isn’t there any other way?

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.000
Your sister’s still recovering, isn’t she?

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.600
Hope you haven’t forgotten what I did for you.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.280
Everyone’s in an uproar, social media’s blowing up.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.600
I got paint thrown on me in public.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.400
Thugs stormed the gym.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.120
The two of us followed through with your orders, boss.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:19.800
And in the end, you had to hand over the entire gym to me.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.840
Well done.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.480
So why did you do it, huh?

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.560
Why the fuck did you ruin my life for?

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.440
You really don’t know, or are you just playing dumb?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.360
Your dad, Kanchit, stole my money!

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.960
Money?!

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.000
The money he put into a crypto wallet.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.240
I tortured him to death but he still wouldn't give up the password.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.760
So I figured, if I squeezed you hard enough...

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.880
maybe you would....

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.160
Sir.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.920
You’ve got an interview with an online outlet about your campaign policy.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.520
Ah, right.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.360
Hey, Keen.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.440
Keen.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.120
Keen, calm down!
Thun.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.520
Keen, take a deep breath.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.240
Thun.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:33.800
Keen…

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.200
It’s not your fault, Keen.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.360
Just breathe, okay?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.360
Phuwish!

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.080
Keen!

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.360
Phuwish, I’ll kill you!

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.080
You bastard, Phuwish!

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.240
You piece of shit! I’ll kill you!

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.120
You scumbag! You monster!

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.240
Keen!

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.320
Look me in the eyes.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.040
Listen carefully to what I’m about to say.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.400
No one’s going to get hurt.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.640
Trust me, Keen.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.720
I’m not lying.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.760
Everyone will be safe.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.480
I’ll give you an answer, but under one condition.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.400
If you don’t back off from this, everything I’ve done for you will fall apart.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.760
I’ve never seen you do anything for me…

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.760
except abandon me.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.160
You’re being tricked, I’m not the one who killed Keen’s father.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.000
If you don’t believe me, everyone’s going to die.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.840
What can I even believe from you anymore?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.000
You’ve been lying to me this whole time.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.120
Listen to me.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.400
Phuwish is Sia Thep.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.080
Huh?! What did you say?

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.800
Pakorn said there’s a plan?

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.080
Keep your voice down, people outside can hear.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.480
Okay, listen up carefully.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.760
Pakorn and I have prepared everything.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.240
You don’t need to worry.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.120
Then why are you helping us now?

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.320
Why should we trust you?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.560
Yeah, especially when you took money from Phuwish.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.160
That damn money?

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.520
I don’t care about it.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.760
Do whatever the hell you want with it.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.160
Tear it up, burn it.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.160
I don’t want it.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:22.400
I was just stupid, thought everything would get better.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.080
I moved to Pakorn’s gym because I wanted a better life.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.160
I wanted to fight in big arenas,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.720
build a name for myself, gain experience.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.160
But then that fucking Phuwish dragged me into this hell.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.120
If I didn’t nearly die, I would’ve had to nearly kill someone else.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.080
I’m really sorry, Uncle Petch.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.560
I was just stupid and lost my way.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.840
I’m sorry.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.200
Hmm. It’s alright.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.320
But Pakorn knows, right? That you never wanted to be here?

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.600
He knows.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.320
Shut your damn mouth already!
Hey!

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.280
People like you deserve this.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.640
Hey!

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.200
Still not done dealing with them?

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.120
I’ve hated these bastards for so long.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.120
Just this much isn’t enough.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200
I’m sorry.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.080
Everyone, we have to act now!

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.440
Hey, wait!

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.120
What if I run away, what about my sister?

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.400
What happens to her?

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.680
Don’t worry, your sister’s safe.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.160
What do you mean?

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.440
Are you sure?

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.800
I’m sure, she’s in a safe house.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.360
Trust me.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.680
Alright, tell us the plan.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.560
What are you doing here?

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.640
Quit acting like a bitch and come with me.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.720
Wow.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.400
Are we actually going to pull this off?

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.400
There’s no other option, we have to.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.040
Uh… could you two stop flirting now?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.800
Hey! I said come with me!

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.480
Now!

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.640
Damn it, do you want to piss me off?

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.120
Easy, easy.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:30.280
Show some respect.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320
Take it easy.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.720
I know you guys don’t like me.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.200
But I like both of you.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.000
I have to admit, I’ve been a fan of yours since you were young.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.440
I kept thinking, what do I have to do

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.840
to get you to fight for me?

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.160
But the problem was…

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.360
Your father kept getting in my way.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.680
But…

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.600
But, then you made everything fall into place.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.600
You got Thun to fight Typhoon again.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.000
To be honest ..

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.640
At first, I didn’t care about you.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.920
I was too fixated on getting back the money your dad took from me.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:53.200
But then you and you met

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.400
and then Thun came back into the ring…

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:09.000
And you kept solving every problem I threw your way.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Everything.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.320
So I was just your puppet, right?

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.560
No.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.240
No, that’s not true.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.680
I never lied to you.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.280
Every time I looked at you,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.280
I saw myself.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.960
Let me tell you. I fought to survive, just like you.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.280
And the more I watched you both…

00:27:52.760 --> 00:28:00.160
before I knew it, I wanted you both for myself.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.840
If you agree to be mine,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.640
I’ll wipe the debt your father left behind.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.960
Not only that, I’ll reward you handsomely.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.440
You can have whatever you want. Everything you lost, you’ll get back.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.440
Everything.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.640
But if you refuse,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.560
then you’ll have to repay the money your father stole from me.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.680
So think carefully, do you want to be a “good person” with nothing?

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:44.240
Or my underling, drowning in pleasure, with everything?

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.880
I refuse.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.480
You refuse?

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:43.360
Then you’ll keep fighting in this ring for me until you die.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.440
Didn’t you say I just have to repay my father’s debt?

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.080
Can you fucking do that?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.480
You don’t even know where he hid the money.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.200
If you can’t repay,

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:10.000
then you’ll work for me, just like Muay’s lackey.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.640
So for today’s first match,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.240
I’m putting Thun in the ring.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.480
Bring in the opponent, let’s make introductions.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.560
As agreed, Mr. Phuwish..

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.720
If I beat Thun, I don’t want money as a reward.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.880
I want everything he owns.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.200
Don’t touch my boyfriend!

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.600
Argh!

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.760
That’s the Keen I like.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.560
I’ll show you that

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.800
Your best weapon isn’t Thun.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.960
I’m not taking it.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.080
If you don’t inject it, you won’t survive this.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.720
I’m still not doing it.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.720
Alright then.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.960
Are you sure everything will be okay?

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:57.200
I know you're probably still confused today, with a head full of chaos.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.720
But I need you to focus on our plan.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.560
What if we don’t succeed?

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.120
If you can’t stop thinking about it,

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.200
just think of me.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.480
Time to get ready, head to the prep area.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.800
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.200
Yay!

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:50.360
Up next, a world-stopping match we’re proud to present!

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.480
Thun the Tiger-Taming Cannon

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.160
vs. Yut Lord of the Martial Art

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:49.040
Yut!
Yut!

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:57.600
Let’s all enjoy this fierce and thrilling match!

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.440
Hey, look at me.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.000
Your opponent’s right here.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
What’s wrong?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.520
Worried about your boyfriend?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.040
Don’t worry. In just a moment,

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.640
everything you have will be mine.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.280
Today we’ll see, the fighter and son you protect so fiercely, Thun…

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.120
and the replacement boy we brought in, Yut…

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.160
Who will stand and who will fall?

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.640
That’s it! Hit hard!

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.080
Hey, help me out here!

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.000
Quick!

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.160
Get up!

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.520
Hey, stop! What are you doing?

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.240
They resisted, tried to escape.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.080
Escape?

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.040
Hey! Stop!

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.320
Thun!

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.880
Hey, Yut’s using a weapon!

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.200
The Tiger-Taming Cannon is bleeding now

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.800
hit by Lord’s deadly move!

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.800
(What’s he going to do now?)
Hey, that’s cheating!

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.480
(Don’t blink, folks!)
Hey, let me go!

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.520
(Something’s definitely going down.)
Hey, let me go!

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.000
Let me go!

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.440
Hey! Hey! Let me go!

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.200
We’re getting out of here!

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.120
Go!
Go, hurry!

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.800
Go!

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.800
Thun!

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.840
Whoa! Let’s give him a round of applause!

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.920
Thun, watch out!

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:02.000
Protect your wound!

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.600
Thun!

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:24.960
Go! Go!
Fight him!

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.280
Tiger-Taming Cannon is finally showing his skills!

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.240
Thun! Protect your injury!

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.520
After taking hits nonstop for a while,

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:24.360
he finally unleashes his deadly Heartless Left Hook!

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.720
Yut!
Yut!

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.640
Is Thun’s deadly move ineffective?

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.800
Thun!

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.720
Slam him! How’s that?!

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.160
Hey! Stop it!

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.320
Hey! Stop it!

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.320
I said stop!

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.480
What the hell?!

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.680
Thun!

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.200
Listen to me carefully, make this place as chaotic as possible.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.040
Blow everything up.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.280
Everyone, run!

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.560
Run, now!

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.080
You really think you can escape me?

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:44.000
I told you, you’ll never get away from me.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Don’t let them escape!

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.880
Track their scent and find them!
Die!

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.720
Is that all you've got? Disappointing.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.080
You love him that much, huh?

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:58.040
Good! Then I’ll take everything that’s yours and make it mine.
