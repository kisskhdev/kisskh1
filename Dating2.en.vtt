WEBVTT

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.440
Was that…

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.560
- Boss.
- Boss.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.760
Let's wrap up "Yuka! Love Me Please"

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.000
properly.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.120
I love you, Yuka.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.600
We're going to start developing a new game.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.880
For this project, Hill will be
the Main Character Designer.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.200
Me?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.840
You better start learning
how to hit on guys.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.040
As you all know, the game we're developing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.800
has to be more lifelike than ever before.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.040
The first and the most important thing.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.280
Just like what we did for
"Yuka! Love Me Please"

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.640
Go ahead.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.800
Are you saying that Yuka's reference

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.840
Nice try, Hill.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
You only need to know
that the selling point

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.240
of "Yuka! Love Me Please"
comes from a real-life idol.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.600
So we're going to build upon
that concept in this game,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440
[crowd murmuring]

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.480
Isn’t that Hojun, the famous artist
with millions of followers?

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.520
Of course,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.840
in your dreams.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He’s just a reference
to get us on the same page.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.880
We need to find someone who's similar.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.800
Hang on.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.040
We're developers, not a casting agent.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.440
I'm so glad you asked, bro.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.640
Since you’re a newbie,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.600
In order to create a good game,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.600
And to know them that deeply,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.760
we’ve got to dig deep to their very cores.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.320
Come here, Hill.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.280
Quickly.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.360
As the fresh new blood here,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.680
you’re our only hope.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.800
From now on, Hill will lead the search
for our character references.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.160
Yay!

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.400
There he goes again.
Passing the buck to the newbie.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.080
I'm just a programmer.
I can't deal with people.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.640
You see, little bro.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.360
I overheard you and Boss talking,
about Yuka being a hostage.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.040
I’m holding Yuka hostage.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600
If you put in the effort,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.920
I might extend Yuka's life.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.280
He extended Yuka's game
for one more year!

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.960
Incredible, right?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.120
Therefore,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.520
you don't get to slack off. Got it?

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.880
For Yuka's sake.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.160
- For Yuka.
- For Yuka. That's right.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.000
Hi there, Hill.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.520
Let's say we had to create

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.160
I think they should be kind and determined,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.880
How's that?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.160
A guy this perfect?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.920
But you're going to find them.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.960
Guys, a round of applause!

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.120
Excuse me, Boss.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.280
Thanks.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.600
So how are things going with your new role?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.320
It's pretty exciting.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.200
Seems easy,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.560
I think.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.600
You think it's easy?

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.360
You sound confident.
Is finding the right person so easy?

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.280
Just so you know,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.760
This company

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.960
isn't a training ground.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.040
You're right, but I'm confident.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.240
I'll be waiting.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.040
Hey.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:40.480
Bay?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.080
Good. I've promised Boss

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.720
[chokes]

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.480
Two days?!

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.040
I wasn't confident.
I kind of blurted it out.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.840
Don't worry.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:15.560
I'm telling you. Two days won't be enough.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.760
Here, look at this.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.480
This guy. He might be
the one we've been looking for.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.000
Fine.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.160
Here, look at this.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.800
This guy. He might be
the one we've been looking for.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.840
Fine.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.480
Hello Mr. Bay and Mr. Hill.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.280
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.560
Allow me to introduce myself again.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.560
I'm Billy. I'm 22 years old.
I have 100 million in savings.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.360
I own 20 luxury cars

00:08:46.800 --> 00:09:04.520
Amazing.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.400
Mr. Billy, not only rich
but also kind-hearted.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.760
Sounds like bragging.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:25.240
- Mr. Billy.
- Yes?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.040
Ten million?!

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.560
Oh, it wasn't a big deal.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.960
Mr. Bill and Mr. Hill,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.400
I promise,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.360
I won’t let either of you down.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.800
Deal.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.680
Thank you, Mr. Billy.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.920
No need to be so formal.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.480
From now on, just call me Billy.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.400
- I'm young, loaded and owns—
- 100 websites.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400
Billy!

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.360
You’re under arrest for
operating 100 illegal websites.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880
Move it.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:31.000
Officer, I think you've made a mistake.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.800
So this guy is young, loaded
and owns illegal websites?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.640
Be considerate. Sounds good.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.760
Bay.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.720
This guy?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.240
Yup.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.600
Let's go.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:04.960
Hello.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.280
Hello.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.400
I’m Bay.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.480
We’re from PRISMSTAR Thailand,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.080
a game developer.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.520
And that's why—

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.560
Wait, was that an earthquake?

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.400
Hey.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.760
You.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.440
Yes?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.640
Yes, just a bit nervous. But I’m fine.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.720
Yeah. You can use the restroom.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.880
Okay, I'll be right back. Excuse me.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.760
That won't do.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.680
Bay.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.320
You see that?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.680
Look at his muscles. His arms!

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.480
Hey, bro!

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.160
Help! Help!

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.720
Here's you hot latte.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.840
Hello, there.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.920
This guy won't let us down. Trust me.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.600
He better not.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.360
If not him, who do we
have left to show Boss?

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.320
Look.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.400
This barista's got a master's from abroad.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.880
to open a café in Thailand.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.240
He brews

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.480
Sounds good.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.760
He is.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.880
And look at the line.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.880
He's clearly popular with the ladies.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.680
Sure.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.880
The guy's got charm.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.120
Here we go.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.720
Hello.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.280
Yes?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.480
I’ll have two iced americanos, please.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.160
Two of the same?

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.600
Okay.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.360
Are you the one with the appointment?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.600
I am.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.800
Alright.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.040
Here you go.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.400
Served with extra loving.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.800
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.920
That's why he's such a promising candidate.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.240
Rejected.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480
But…

00:14:50.960 --> 00:15:01.560
Great profile, good looks.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:09.520
Two wives, three kids, hurts women,
ran off to study abroad for three years,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.480
Do you think someone with
these issues is right for the role?

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.320
Well…

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.800
No.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.440
I remember it now.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.480
No wonder why he looked familiar.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.400
That's the "Charming Casanova" influencer.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.360
[sighs]

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.000
I don’t know how hard you worked,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.480
but for me,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.960
it’s not enough.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.440
If I had not done my own research

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.640
and we'd picked him as our guy,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.840
what do you think the game
would’ve turned out like?

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.120
Carelessness could hurt the company.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.520
Is that all?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.440
Of course not.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.480
See?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.160
Not as easy as you thought, right?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
[mimicking] I did my homework.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.200
Every candidate I've chosen are top-notch.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.800
How's that?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.080
Feeling defeated yet?

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:51.280
Come on, don’t rub it in.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.120
But none of them passed.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:02.440
Boss is way too hardcore.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.640
This is just the start,
and it's already this difficult.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.040
Seriously though.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.400
they would have to be heaven sent.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.280
Stop pleading with the heavens.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.800
We want a normal person.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.040
Hill, meet me in my office
before you leave.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.600
Yes, sir.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.320
- Bay.
- Yeah?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.080
No way.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.560
He asked for you, not me.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.200
But

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.840
what do we do now?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.640
That's easy, man.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.320
How?

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.400
When in doubt, hit the bar.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.720
I don't drink.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.280
Just so you know,
this particular bar is full of hotties

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.520
like me.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.560
Come on. You just sit with us and watch.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.440
Don't make him wait. I'll be downstairs.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.840
Boss.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:38.400
First, I want to apologize.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.360
Thai people like to
keep things light and funny.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.880
You think I called you in over that?

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:57.520
If it's about work, there's no need worry.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.360
What is it, Boss?

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.800
A welcome gift for our new employee.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.320
That’s the reason I called you in.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.400
Sorry it's a bit late.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.080
You know what? This is

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.320
How come?

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.440
Well.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
The only one I'm close with is Yuka-chan.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.760
I'm not so close

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.880
Thank you, Boss.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.160
Open it.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.640
Can I?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.600
Why a water bottle, Boss?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.000
Because you love grilled pork skewers.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.040
Did you know, each skewer
has 500 mg of sodium?

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.440
Too much can be dangerous.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.560
So drink lots of water.
And from the way you work,

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.160
Why are you smiling?

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.760
You just remind me of my mom.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.200
Thanks again, Boss.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.160
And don’t worry.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.560
I’ll make sure it gets put to good use.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.640
And I'll hit the daily water goal as well.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.320
That's it for today. You can go.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.240
Okay. I’ll repay you with
some grilled pork skewers!

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.600
Don't bother.
Just find me the right person.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.120
Roger that!

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560
You forgot this.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.560
Just go already.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.920
Your "roger that" was bad.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.240
Ice would love to work with you.
But she's fully booked for this year.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.400
We're really sorry.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.120
That's a shame. I look forward to
working together in the future.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.240
You still eat a ton like you did in school.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.480
Especially when you're stressed.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.400
You haven’t changed,
still as observant as ever.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.360
It's called “being nosy” in Thai.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.160
Are you throwing shade at me?

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.280
You said it yourself, not me.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200
Let’s keep eating.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.320
Wow.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.120
Say it’s not tasty and
I’ll make you eat somewhere else.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:51.080
Thanks for helping me
contact the artist's manager.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.400
No worries, we’re all friends.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:04.160
Yeah, at least we found out

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.400
Basically, no one’s taking the job.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200
Hot!

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.840
Don’t forget that it’s hot.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.160
Did you bite into a chili too?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.280
Drink some water.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.320
Relax. The right one always
shows up at the right time.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.640
Looks like the time is now, friend.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.120
Perfect timing.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.960
Perfect for you

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.600
who always forget to pay.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.840
Seriously, Bay.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.000
Hey, I heard that.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.840
Come on, relax a little.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.880
Step away from your desk
and enjoy yourself.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.960
Don’t be a workaholic.
Go ahead and order, it’s my treat.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.000
Bottoms up.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.920
For real?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.040
Hello there, Bay.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.920
You remember me?

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.280
How could I forget?

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760
You went to the restroom and disappeared.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.360
I was worried.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.480
I thought you drowned in the toilet.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.280
That’s it, I flushed you.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.600
Now drift down the pipe and into

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.160
Bay, she just called you crap.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.400
Hill, just shut up.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.480
Hang on.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.800
So badass. So dangerous.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.640
I'm only asking you for one thing.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.080
If anyone at work hears about this…

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.720
you're so dead!

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.800
Damn. A death threat?

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.240
Got it. I give you my word.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.200
But look at this, we failed today.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.000
And now you're drenched in plum wine.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.480
The day’s not over yet.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.120
Over there. That guy.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.960
Wow.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.680
Just so you know,

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.280
The bartender Gotji. He studied
overseas and has spotless record.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.000
While you mess around casting people,

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.000
A charming man who can make

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.400
A man who’s never had a girlfriend.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.480
So this is it.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.400
Cheers.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.920
For you, I'll drink it all.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.120
I heard from the manager team

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.120
that it's your project.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.200
So I was immediately interested.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.920
Actually, I’m a fan of yours too.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.880
Here.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.000
A young, passionate CEO like you

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.320
This might be a bit outdated now,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.320
As a memento.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:49.840
Gladly.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.480
Let me explain the details to you.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.400
How about this?

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.440
Let’s talk about this over dinner.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.120
If the job sounds as good as your profile,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.120
I’ll say yes tonight.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.120
Fair enough.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.800
Alright, it’s settled.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.520
Shall we go together by car?

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.000
Here comes trouble.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.200
What trouble?

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.320
What's wrong?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.560
Don't tell me that woman is also—

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:18.320
Hey, wait up!

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.080
I should've let you
struggle all on your own.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.680
Don’t be mad, man.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.800
Seriously, though.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.840
Your life wouldn't be this messy.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.760
They all say I'm a player.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.360
Actually, I'm pretty straightforward.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.520
Is it wrong to stop seeing them
when I'm no longer interested?

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.320
Bay. Hey, Bay!

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.200
I just can’t bring myself to reject people.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.320
Bay, she picked up the glass.
This is like deja vu.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.120
I'm sorry,

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.640
You better leave

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.040
or you'll become prey.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.320
Bay!

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.600
Where did he go?!

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.960
Where'd that player run off to?

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.480
No idea.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.000
He left a plain guy like me behind.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.120
Damn, he’s fast.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.080
Fine. I’ll go solo.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.280
Hi, there.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.080
Are you Got—

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400
Gotji.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.280
Mr. Gotji.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.000
Did Bay contact you about
being our reference material?

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.440
And Mr. Bay?

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.960
Something urgent came up,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.720
I'm guessing he'd told you
some basic details already.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.160
Well.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.440
Didn't he tell you that

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.960
You’re kinda cute.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.080
Sorry?

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.440
You’re cute. Looking flustered like that.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.440
Boss.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.120
So what do I have to do

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.160
If you beat me, I'll say yes.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.040
Reference material for
the game is very important.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.800
And you’ve got both
the reputation and professionalism.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.440
That’s not fair. You already
know everything about me.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.640
I want to know about you too.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.560
More than the game, actually.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.040
It’s no fun drinking alone.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.480
Sorry, cocktails aren’t really my thing.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.920
Come on, humor me.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.480
For tonight.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.200
Excuse me.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.560
Bring us a large set of Special B52.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.120
Just so you know, I'm really good at this.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.120
You know the rules?
Whoever pockets the 9 ball wins.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.440
Last round, you cleared
the table all by yourself.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.560
This round, let’s spice things up a bit.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.400
If you get bitten,
you chug all three shots.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.520
So who gets the final say
on the reference material?

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:55.800
That would…

00:33:59.320 --> 00:33:59.800
be me.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.240
Since you picked me,
that means you like me right?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.840
Here you go.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.200
What are you looking at? You giving up?

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.960
Let me tell you this. You've lost
the moment you missed your shot.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.320
You sound so confident.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.120
For every ball you pocket,

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:54.320
[cheering] Woohoo! Let's go!

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.600
Crap.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.280
What do I do?
I didn’t even get his contact info!

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.560
I won.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.080
Let’s go.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.520
Come on.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.800
Get in.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.440
Boss isn't one to leave his jacket behind.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.920
How about a kiss?

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.360
To test it out for the game.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080
If you don't want to,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.760
I’ll do it myself.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.840
Boss.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.000
Boss! Get over here.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.440
Let's go, Boss.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.200
Who are you?

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.240
I’m his bodyguard, obviously.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.440
His bodyguard, huh?

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.920
You're drunk.
Go home and sleep it off,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.160
or this is going public. Your call.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.640
You’ll regret this.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.680
That’s your opinion, man.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.680
Calm down, please.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.240
Go away!

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.960
Please, get in the car.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.320
Boss.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.320
Go home!

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.520
Take us away from here.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.200
I,

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.160
My pleasure, Boss.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.560
Don't worry.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:38:59.880
Yeah, right.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.640
That smile means you liked my joke, Boss.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:14.680
I'm serious. You don't have to worry about

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.480
Just let it go. Because today

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.320
And it looks like I've found the right guy.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.360
I'm talking about this guy.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:34.040
He might not look
presentable in the photos.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.160
Hey, Boss?

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.800
Well. Thank you for listening, Boss.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.360
Boss?

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.880
Hey.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:06.200
I have no idea where you live.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.920
Boss?

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.560
Here we go.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.600
Just sit here for now, okay?

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.680
Easy now.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.640
Just sit

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.640
and wait for a bit, okay?

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.680
Yuka, can you teach me
how to cure a hangover?

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.320
You have a hangover, Hill?
There are many ways to deal with it.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.040
Then give me the quickest and easiest one.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:26.520
I recommend ginger tea.
Sipping ginger tea or a soup

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:28.880
Ginger tea.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.600
One second.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.760
Perfect, I have some.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.760
That should do it.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:59.600
Thanks a lot, Yuka.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.520
Ginger tea. Careful, it's hot.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.960
She said it would help with your hangover.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.600
It worked for me, at least.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.240
You made this? Is it really drinkable?

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.280
Come on, Boss. It's just ginger tea.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.440
How is it?

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:39.160
We’ll have to see

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.960
Ouch.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.400
Please wait for a bit. I'll be back soon.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.840
Coming through.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:31.680
Boss, you should rest here for the night.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.120
Okay.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.320
Wait.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.560
I mean, you should sleep on the bed.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:56.200
Why? I can take the floor.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.280
No, you can't do that.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.400
Because this bed sheet
has Yuka-chan all over it.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.520
Only I can sleep on it.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.200
Really?

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.600
Even the bed sheet has Yuka-chan on it.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.040
I see. I get it.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.880
Here you go, Boss.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.160
Just lie down here.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.720
Okay.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:29.600
Thanks.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.280
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.520
I see.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.960
You go first.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.160
I wanted to apologize, Boss.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.560
I don't think Hojun will agree

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.360
to be our reference anymore.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.720
I think I messed it up.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.160
There's no need.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.800
I should be thanking you for saving me.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.960
I’m sorry…

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.800
for being so difficult.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.960
And making everyone’s job harder.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:08.560
I believe that if we end up with
the wrong person, it could ruin

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.200
what everyone has worked so hard on.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.840
Hey.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:31.080
I want to see everyone succeed
and be happy doing the work we love.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:40.080
I want us to be a team

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.480
and succeeds together.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.360
We'll succeed, for sure. And your dream

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.080
will definitely come true.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.000
Rise and shine! You have work today, Hill.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.080
Time to wake up and get ready for work.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.880
Morning, Yuka.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.360
Boss.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.880
Oh, it's in Japanese.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.160
Thanks for last night. Don’t be late.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.040
Team, I have good news to share with you.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.560
We've got our game's character reference!

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.320
[cheers and applause]

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.080
And that person is

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.440
Ho-jun, famous artist
with millions of followers!

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:49.520
Exciting, right? He confirmed
with me this morning

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.840
Well, I just turned him down.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:01.200
But why?

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.640
I’ve already found the perfect guy
to be the reference for our game.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.480
But Gotji's got nothing on Hojun.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.640
I'm not talking about him.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.080
Then who are you talking about?

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.320
Hear me out.

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.880
Who has all the right qualifications?

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.880
Who has no scandals,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
a strong presence,

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.080
and is reliable,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.760
and perfect in every way?

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.280
A talented person with fame,

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.040
proven trustworthy,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.240
and a kind heart that all of us can feel.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.720
That person is right here with us.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.040
Wait, don't tell me—

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:07.720
And that person is…

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:14.040
Our very own boss, Junji-san!

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:17.600
What?

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.760
Think about it, guys.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.760
If users log into the game

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.600
and meet someone as perfect as him.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.480
How happy would they be?

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.960
Our Boss is

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.320
Sorry but I can't.
I don't think I'm ready.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.240
Boss, Japan is pressing us again.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600
Well…

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.600
Fine.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:23.600
[applause and cheers]

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.640
Alright! Our next step is to charm Boss
who's our game's reference material.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.920
We want it to feel real,

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.840
it’s got to be you,

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.680
no doubt about it.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.320
You.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.200
Boss.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Let me woo you.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.760
This date

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.760
Boss.

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.880
So where did you go?

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:42.960
Don't tell me

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.960
you wore Thai costumes to Wat Arun,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.840
With the time we’ve got left,

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.160
I just want to be with you

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.360
and making you happy.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.320
Goodnight.
