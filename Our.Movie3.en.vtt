"THE LONELY PEOPLE" WAITING AREA

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.709
Ms. Lee Daeum.

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.422
Is Ms. Lee Daeum here?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.258
Lee Daeum?

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.342
Hey.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.844
Isn't Lee Daeum
the one Mr. Lee had his eye on?

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.013
Exactly.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.849
We even confirmed she was coming.
What's up with her?

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.700
- I'll just move on.
- Hmm.

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.203
Next up, Chae Seoyoung.

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:19.788
- Yes?
- You can head in.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.582
Okay.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.166
Just relax.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.252
I took a look around,

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.796
and you're the only one fit for the lead.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:30.674
Okay. Good luck.

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:34.511
Hello.

EPISODE 3

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.722
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.767
Yes, Mr. Lee!

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.894
Where do you live? I mean,

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.396
what's your hospital room number?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.148
I'm out of the hospital now.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.359
Didn't you say
you had to stay at the hospital?

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.528
I switched to outpatient treatment.
I'll explain later.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.908
So where are you staying now?
Give me your address.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.660
Why?

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:41.328
So I can send you the script.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.877
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:55.509
Mr. Lee?

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.885
Yes. Why did you hang up?

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.512
What do you mean by that?

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:02.349
What would it mean when a director
sends his script to an actress?

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.520
I'll see you later.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.115
Thank you!

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.996
TIME FOR MEDS

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.274
Hello, Dr. Lee.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.984
Okay, don't worry.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:40.363
She can run all she wants,
but she's still in the palm of our hands.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.449
So you're really dead set on this, huh?

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:48.038
- What's this? Is it for me?
- Mm-mmm.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.373
Did you have a fight with your father?

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.917
Did something happen?

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.504
- She ran away.
- How could you?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.631
She's in her teen rebellion phase
in her 20s.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.090
BONE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.467
So these are bribes.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.553
Not bribes. They're gifts.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:05.806
Auntie.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.227
Well, look at our Daeum
acting completely out of the norm.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.687
These look great.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.900
Makes sense. You've been
juggling the café and the house.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.194
Can I take some too?

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.029
Don't you dare.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:26.451
I've been bumping into things,
getting sore all over lately,

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:27.619
so this is perfect.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.330
It's important to stay proactive
with this stuff.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.123
Sure.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.002
Mmm. So thoughtful.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.006
You offered Seoyoung the role of Junghwa?

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.927
Everyone knows
Chae Seoyoung should get the lead.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.763
It's an old melodrama,
so why not try some new casting?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.682
New? Who?

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.559
You mean Lee Daeum?

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:51.935
Come on, this isn't Hollywood!

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.288
Weren't you the one swooning over
how this was like <i>La La Land</i>?

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.731
But that film's lead, Emma Watson,
was an A-list actress

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.441
that everyone in the world knew!

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.403
Here in Korea, only Chae Seoyoung
is on the level of Emma Watson...

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.280
Not Watson, Stone. Emma Stone.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.614
What?

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:06.992
…son.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.285
Hey, stop nitpicking.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.121
Why are you so stuck on Lee Daeum?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.622
What is it about her?

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.293
She's got something. Something we don't.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.671
Anyway, you promised to support me
over soju and cold noodles.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.735
You haven't forgotten already, right?

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.134
I'm off.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.475
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.104
Crazy bastard.
Acting like he's making some art.

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.566
What about the female lead?

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.862
Word's been out for a while
that Seoyoung's got the part.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.990
You two costarring would be great for us.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.327
As long as you both
stay away from a scandal.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.621
Great for who exactly?

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.835
No…
…that wouldn't be great for anyone.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.674
Should be coming any minute now.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.220
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.348
She's so pretty.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.728
Seoyoung! What are you doing here?

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.730
Mr. Bu.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.691
Jeha doesn't know
you sent this script to me, does he?

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.110
He doesn't.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.740
It seems like Jeha
doesn't want to cast me,

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.534
but you want to because of the investors.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.994
How did you know?

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.540
How can an actress be in a project
if the director doesn't want her?

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.003
It's funny, though.
Why doesn't he want me?

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:46.049
He's fixated on some rookie
from the audition.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.303
A rookie?

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.097
Don't worry. You're Chae Seoyoung.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.058
You just need to do it. I'll make it happen.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.811
You haven't even told him about this.
What can you do?

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:01.147
Don't worry about how it looks.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.315
Seoyoung,

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.359
just leave Jeha to me.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.113
I think you got the order wrong.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.198
I should speak to Jeha first.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.282
We'll meet

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.159
and decide it for ourselves.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.788
Goodness. You shouldn't trouble yourself.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.582
- See you!
- Take care.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.376
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.004
Of course,

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:28.591
you should go to him directly
and decide if for yourselves, hmm?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:29.759
That's how it should go.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:37.183
Hey, do you want a scoop for an article?

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.403
Mr. Lee!

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.535
What's this?

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.333
What about it?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.296
I've never been dumped before,

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:09.132
but this sure feels
like being dumped for no reason.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.676
It's like it says here. She's "in talks."

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.262
We're deciding if the role of Gyuwon

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.473
should go to Chae Seoyoung
or you, a rookie.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.434
Casts change all the time,
even in the middle of filming.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.895
And there are literally
hundreds of reasons for that.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.230
Hundreds? Really?

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.859
I'm saying…

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:30.528
The lead was originally

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.823
offered to Chae Seoyoung, but she passed.

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:37.577
Then you aced the audition
and became next in line.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.621
That's my side of the story,
as the director.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.083
The studio has its own take.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.170
But why her, of all people?

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.296
"Of all people"?

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:49.964
I just really like her.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:52.926
So that's what this is about.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.887
In that case, I like you best
for the role of Gyuwon.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.268
Anyway, I'm not giving up this time.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.270
"This time"?

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.148
Yes.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.068
We should've signed an agreement
or something first.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.408
- Let's go.
- Go where?

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:19.828
You said we should sign an agreement.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.756
THE WIDOW A WOMAN JUDGE

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.386
Wow.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.304
What would you like?

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.350
The worst thing on the menu.

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.185
Everything's pretty bad here,

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.062
so just pick anything.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:48.707
KIWI BASIL PESTO,
TANGERINE RAMYEON,

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.211
TANGERINE CURRY NOODLES,
CUCUMBER RICE

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.319
What can I get you?

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.821
Yeah, the worst thing on the menu.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.823
I was just kidding.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.200
The best thing on the menu, please.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:02.412
Okay, then give us
the best-looking bad dish.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.540
Of course. Got it.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.046
Is he a friend?

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.134
Yes.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.012
I didn't know you had friends.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.598
Wow, that's unexpected. Hmm.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:41.367
Don't people usually take meds
after eating?

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.871
Yes, I have to take more meds
after eating too.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.749
Don't be so surprised.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.795
You swallowed everything at once.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.091
You're not good
at swallowing pills, are you?

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.554
I'm so proud of myself now.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.431
There's something I'm better at than you.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:08.645
Like you said, we do need an agreement.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.899
All you've got are some clips of you
doing monologues against a wall.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.109
So why do you think I want to cast you?

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.611
For realism?

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.739
That's right. I'm casting someone
with a terminal illness

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.158
to play a terminally ill character.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:25.078
If the world hears about this,

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.873
people will call me
unethical and exploitative

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.834
and I'll be completely ruined.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.172
I think you're overreacting a bit.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:39.300
If you can't take this risk seriously,
then there's no agreement.

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:40.385
No.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:44.347
Who could be more serious than someone
who's risking her life just to be here?

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.725
I'm also serious enough
to risk getting my life

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.394
ruined for this.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.188
First condition of this agreement:

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.858
no one on the outside
can find out about your illness.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.528
And for that,
since I'm the only one who knows,

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.197
I need to know you inside and out,
more than anyone else.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:03.574
The second condition is…

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.452
You can't die until the film is finished.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.415
Let's sign a confidentiality agreement
for both our sakes.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.709
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.420
I have a condition too.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.130
Okay, go on.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:19.924
I won't die.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.260
So you'd better not ruin the movie.

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.724
Let's end today's meeting here.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.477
Mr. Han.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.689
Do you really think <i>Love in White</i>
is worth investing in?

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:38.943
People think that the Youngjin Group
only cares about turning a profit.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.904
If we show them we're trying our best

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.449
to protect the ecosystem
of our creative industries,

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.326
it sends a message
that we're the ones who stay

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.786
when everyone backs out.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.457
I do trust Mr. Bu,
since he has the Midas touch.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.417
No, that's not it.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.502
This film's not about him.

00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.214
It entirely depends on Lee Jeha.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.884
It feels like he'll do anything

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.428
to make this movie.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.680
But I'm the director.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.850
Why do you think I'd ruin my own film?

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.186
This is a romance film.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.772
How can its theme be "Love doesn't exist"?

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.983
Precisely. This isn't a romance film.

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.737
Love is the last thing this film needs.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.284
But even when Hyunsang
leaves Gyuwon behind to go back to Seoul,

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:29.660
that's all love.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:33.539
Hyunsang must've wanted
to prove something to Gyuwon.

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:38.544
I'm sorry. It's an important shoot
that I just couldn't postpone.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.004
I'll be back soon.

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.768
Can you really call it "love"
when the man leaves,

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.978
knowing the woman is going to die?

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.689
The man was selfish.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:14:59.899
And the woman…

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.653
Was hopelessly foolish.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.699
Here's your tangerine <i>ramyeon</i>.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.952
Oh.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:14.997
- Thank you!
- Sure.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.834
Tangerine <i>ramyeon</i>…

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.228
Hmm?

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:43.526
Is it good?

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:46.737
Mmm.

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:03.629
Thank you.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.178
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.472
I know this is your script,

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.850
but I'll still give it my best too.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.227
Just you wait.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.938
I will put love into this film,
no matter what.

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.653
You know this is only
between the two of us, right?

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.364
Yes. Understood.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.449
I can do it!

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.034
I won't let you down.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:38.414
CHAE SEOYOUNG: MR. LEE,
WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S TALK.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.686
SEOYOUNG IN TALKS FOR REMAKE
OF DUYOUNG'S LOVE IN WHITE

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.047
Mr. Bu. So you're just going
to keep dodging my calls, huh?

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.049
Ma'am, please try to stay calm.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:49.926
Where is she right now?

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.178
I'm not sure. She won't answer my calls.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.976
Do you really think
she'd pick up the phone right now?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.394
Go find her!

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.479
Yes, ma'am!

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.121
The press got to it
before we even got to meet.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.957
Mr. Bu's good at spinning a narrative.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.417
Did you read the script?

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.797
- I did.
- Which role do you want to play?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.261
So I'm not automatically the lead, am I?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.264
Did you find someone better?

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:38.391
Yes, I did.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.685
Does that mean

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.062
you've already made up your mind?

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:45.314
I have.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.691
Why?

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:47.858
Are you interested?

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:49.819
Yes, I am.

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.004
I found someone perfect at the audition

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.948
and I've already decided.

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.950
I'll convince Mr. Bu however I can.

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.203
I meant a different kind of interest.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.415
That main character was just too sad.

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.793
And you know how much I hate sad.

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:08.254
I'd rather play Junghwa.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:10.923
She was totally me.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:13.593
She's driven by desire,

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:15.469
she's honest, insufferable,

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:16.721
and self-absorbed.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.236
I wonder if you wrote her with me in mind.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.811
I did think you'd be a good fit.

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:31.652
No need to correct the article, right?

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.030
I am in talks for the movie, after all.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.366
Ms. Go might feel differently.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.495
Of all the hurdles you'll have to clear,
that's probably one of the easier ones.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.624
I can handle her.

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:46.250
So?

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.544
Who's playing the lead?

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.383
Lee Daeum.

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:58.554
I guess I'm a little jealous.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.849
She must have something I don't.

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.734
Yes, this is Noh Huitae from Npatch.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.819
<i>Mr. Noh, this is Chae Seoyoung.</i>

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.071
Why, hello.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.405
FROM LEAD TO SUPPORTING?
CHAE SEOYOUNG SHIFTS GEARS

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.076
Everyone!

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.787
Get out there right now and find Seoyoung.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.711
FROM LEAD TO SUPPORTING?
CHAE SEOYOUNG SHIFTS GEARS

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:34.048
So that's how it played out.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.593
Seems like they got to meet safely.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.847
That's how it is? You'd take a side role
just to be in Lee Jeha's movie?

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.392
Absolutely ridiculous.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.062
Hey, Jeha.

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:50.523
I think it's about time we talked.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:55.152
I think if something clearly won't
get resolved through talking,

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.029
it's better to skip it and save the time.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.714
Fine. Then I'll skip
all the "what do you think,"

00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:17.717
"can we talk about this,"
and "maybe we reconsider" nonsense.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:20.469
Just change the casting.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:22.638
I can't do that.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.516
Then can you explain why you can't?

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.643
Lee Daeum's acting.

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.855
You've seen it too.
You know it's hard to deny.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.108
You're better than anyone
at spotting star power.

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.235
There's a bit of a spark, I'll give you that.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.947
Then what's with the script?

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.407
You want to deface the original?

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.206
A romance film without love?
What even is that?

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:46.912
Is love really so great?

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:51.709
It's the first thing people throw out
if it gets in the way of survival.

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:52.793
Fine.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.503
Love isn't everything.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:58.132
But it should be in a movie at least.

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.718
Why would people pay that much

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.512
to watch a story
that's exactly like their own lives?

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.056
What's the point
if there's no hope or fantasy?

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:09.101
<i>What if I die during filming? It'll go viral.</i>

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.437
A terminal patient
playing a terminal role?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.105
Even I'd want to watch that.

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.775
People will come

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.985
if there's something to watch
that can replace

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.237
hope and fantasy.

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:24.158
Going somewhere?

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:25.493
To practice.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.955
Why? To practice what?

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:32.875
I got a script.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:34.794
Do you even know

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.924
what it means when a director
gives an actor a script?

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.469
What does it mean?

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.638
It means

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:50.392
"I want to cast you
for a role on this project."

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:53.854
Did you really get cast in a movie?

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.692
That's why I have to practice like crazy.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.694
- I'm heading out.
- Hang on.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:02.071
You practice here.

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.739
- I'll leave.
- No.

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:07.493
I don't want to be a bother.

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:11.247
What's really a bother is you
pushing yourself too hard out there.

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.499
Just hurry up, then.

00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:15.501
I'm leaving without you if you don't!

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:16.877
- Okay.
- Heading somewhere?

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.296
Yes, we won't take too long.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.048
Hang on, let me get my jacket!

00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:26.345
DAEUM'S DAD: GYOYEONG,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE DAEUM IS?

00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:29.557
Gyo! You can just stand over there.

00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.393
So? Do I look okay?

00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:35.563
No, you look yellow.

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:38.899
Director Gyo,
please go all the way up there.

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:43.487
Does my jawline look nice?

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.364
- How do I look?
- Yes, great.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.158
Don't drop your arms
because you get tired.

00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:50.452
Don't worry, focus on the emotion.

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:51.871
I believe in you.

00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:53.163
Focus!

00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:54.915
You didn't press "record"!

00:22:58.586 --> 00:22:59.587
Okay, then.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.676
"I'm also breaking apart

00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:07.386
and coming together."

00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:15.686
GYOYEONG: AT SEODAEMUN PARK.

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.146
JUST SAW FROM AFAR. LEAVING NOW.

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:22.026
Daeum.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.322
Daeum!

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.115
Hurry and call an ambulance! Daeum!

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:29.783
- D-Dad!
- An ambulance!

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:31.535
- I'm here.
- I-I'm sorry.

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:33.037
- It's okay.
- I-I'm really sorry.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.581
Sorry about what? It's okay.
We'll go to the hospital.

00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:37.304
I'm just acting for the camera right now.

00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:39.001
- What?
- For the camera.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.297
The character I play is sick.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.554
Are you really all right?

00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:56.101
What the heck were you thinking?

00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:57.937
Dad

00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:00.940
I'm preparing for something.

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:04.401
- For what?
- For a film shoot.

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:06.820
What's she saying?

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.991
Well, she actually passed an audition

00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:12.785
and became the lead.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.121
I got the lead!

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.541
Aren't you proud of me?

00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.883
Why are you indulging her, Gyoyeong? Huh?

00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.345
You know she's sick.

00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:33.305
Just go back inside.

00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:35.808
Enough with the crazy talk.
Go inside. It's cold.

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:41.522
- No!
- Get a grip, Daeum!

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:45.943
How can I get a grip?

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.320
I passed an audition.

00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:51.532
Dad… aren't you proud?

00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:53.742
I'm going to be in a movie.

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:54.827
I'm not proud.

00:24:55.828 --> 00:24:57.705
What can you even do in that condition?

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.290
Please, just stop! Please!

00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:04.420
At this rate, you might not even make it
through half the time you've got left.

00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.755
Making movies?

00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:09.633
Come to your senses.

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:11.343
Just stop.

00:25:14.263 --> 00:25:17.599
I'd rather live half my time like this
than a full year in a hospital bed.

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:26.900
Dad… I'm sorry.

00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:29.570
That was a bit harsh.

00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:59.475
I'm not sure how you expect me
to react to this.

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.978
It's like thinking outside the box.

00:26:03.062 --> 00:26:05.439
Okay, and why should we do that?

00:26:06.023 --> 00:26:08.150
- For the story, of course.
- The story?

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.653
You said the story around the film
is more important than the film itself.

00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:13.822
Something that grabs people's interest.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:18.827
All right, then let's hear it.
What's the story here?

00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:22.331
A rookie strong enough
to knock a top star out of the lead.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.707
That's going to be…

00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:26.001
Where we start.

00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:28.962
And that start is
knocking off Chae Seoyoung?

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:31.507
The media will take care of the framing.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.302
You're more ambitious
than I thought, Mr. Lee.

00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:39.807
But there are a lot of
stakeholders in this investment deal.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.519
A few headlines aren't enough for me

00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:45.938
to convince those old guards.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:48.565
I'll show you. With just one scene.

00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:52.486
Let me show you what a desperate actor
and a hungry director

00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:55.364
can pull off together.

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:58.450
If that story doesn't sell it,

00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:00.786
pull the funding.

00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:03.330
Hey, Director Lee!

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:05.457
Jeha.

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.459
What got into you today?

00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:08.961
Call it desperation.

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:12.172
Never seen that from you before.
Sure, I'll take it.

00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:13.298
I like it.

00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:15.509
But this is a gamble,
and you didn't run it by me.

00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:18.192
If you spin Seoyoung that way,
we could lose the Junghwa role too.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.763
No, she'll do it.

00:27:19.847 --> 00:27:22.724
If she cared about that stuff,
she wouldn't have come to me.

00:27:23.684 --> 00:27:26.270
I'm counting on you to handle Ms. Go.

00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:28.564
So you make the mess, and I clean it up.

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:29.815
Let's say Seoyoung's in.

00:27:29.898 --> 00:27:32.150
But what are you planning to do
in that one scene?

00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:33.986
You'd have to trust me on that

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.865
while you start assembling the crew.

00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:40.409
Ji Cheolmin has to take the camera.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.952
So Wonyeong for editing.

00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:43.328
Cheon Seeun for music.

00:27:44.288 --> 00:27:45.664
Oh, and Choi Eunsu for art.

00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:50.419
Wow, you're just listing
the busiest people in the business.

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:52.671
One week. No later than that.

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:56.383
This coming from the guy
who always dragged his feet?

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:58.427
I can't tell what he's thinking at all.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.720
Doing whatever he wants.

00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:01.555
Think I'm some miracle worker?

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.390
Well, I am.

00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:09.646
Sorry I came unannounced. I was in a rush.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.316
It's fine.
There are a lot of eyes out there anyway.

00:28:12.983 --> 00:28:14.359
As long as you're okay with this.

00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:18.196
- So this is the scene for the test shoot.
- Yes.

00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:22.019
Where's this confidence coming from that
the one scene is enough for the investors?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.870
From the two leads, Lee Daeum and you.

00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:28.290
When did you start trusting
some rookie from an audition like that?

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:30.626
From the first time I met her.

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.336
You'll get it when you see her.

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:34.171
What if this doesn't work?

00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:35.672
You don't have to worry about that.

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:39.259
A film that can't even convince
its investors shouldn't be made at all.

00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:46.099
What made you come back from hiding
and start making this film?

00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:50.228
Who is this actress who made you do that?
Now you've got me curious.

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:54.858
Do you want to meet her with me?

00:28:55.525 --> 00:28:56.526
No,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.153
I don't want to.

00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:01.448
I want to meet her without you.

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:04.242
Let the two of us meet first.

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.036
I want to do it right.

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:08.705
All right, then.

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.750
But don't tell Lee Daeum

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:14.169
that this test shoot
decides the fate of this film.

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:16.588
Shouldn't she know?

00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:19.424
No, it'll put too much pressure on her.

00:29:20.968 --> 00:29:23.804
Jeha is insisting
that it has to be you, Cheolmin.

00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:26.556
I swear, I almost teared up.

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:29.768
I'd love to work
with a director like Mr. Lee.

00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:31.019
I know how talented he is.

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:35.607
That's why it was sad to watch
him disappear for years.

00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:38.235
But then, why?

00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:43.198
Honestly?
You can't call this <i>Love in White</i>.

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.117
More like <i>Love in Black</i>.

00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:48.954
It just felt way too dark.

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:53.542
I have to head out first
to do something for Mr. Lee.

00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:57.421
Mr. Ji says he can't do it.

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:00.716
Okay, I'll call him myself.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.384
I should at least meet him.

00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:06.430
- Mr. Lee.
- Hmm?

00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:08.974
Whether it's <i>Love in White, Black,</i> or <i>Red,</i>

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:12.060
don't let it get to you. Stay strong.

00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:13.186
<i>Take care.</i>

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.486
You still don't drink these days, right?

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.571
I don't.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.575
- I know it's late, but is coffee okay?
- Coffee's great.

00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:30.454
Look, don't take it the wrong way.

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:33.498
You mean when you called it <i>Love in Black</i>?
And that's why you passed on it?

00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:35.208
What I mean is…

00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:37.377
Could you take a look at this?

00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:40.756
It ends with the camera on her back?

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:44.176
Yes, and it's shot hand held.
You know, what you do best.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.679
Right, I did think the ending
for the terminally ill lead

00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:50.390
should actually feel dynamic and alive.

00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:53.560
Ah. I mean, it was just a thought.

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:54.978
Mr. Ji,

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:59.941
I really want to make this film

00:31:00.984 --> 00:31:02.152
with you.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.989
Ah, screw it. I'm in.

00:31:06.073 --> 00:31:07.741
Okay, you've convinced me.

00:31:07.824 --> 00:31:10.452
But I'm all tied up right after winter,

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.370
so my schedule's tight.

00:31:12.454 --> 00:31:15.123
Well, I want to shoot this film quickly.

00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:17.292
Literally, very fast.

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.086
Okay, but…

00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:21.671
Why do you need it to be so fast?

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:25.842
I don't have much time.

00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:28.970
- Take care, then.
- Good night.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.898
<i>I really want</i>

00:31:40.607 --> 00:31:42.192
to make this movie

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:45.612
with you.

00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:49.658
It really does work.

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:56.873
Hello?

00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:06.633
- Are you Lee Daeum?
- Hello, Ms. Chae.

00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:08.260
I've seen you before.

00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:12.806
The sandwich. That was you, right?

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.474
Do you remember me?

00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:16.726
Wow, this is such a funny coincidence.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.645
Or is it destiny?

00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:21.565
Should we head in?

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:26.403
I take it you didn't like anything
from the list I sent you?

00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:29.948
Mr. Lee's trying to avoid anywhere
that feels too artificial.

00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:33.827
You said this is for a test shoot, right?

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.704
Yes, it's a test,

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.623
but we'll carry it through
to the main shoot.

00:32:39.249 --> 00:32:41.084
I hope you don't mind the trouble.

00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:44.880
Oh, it's no trouble.
This is my job, after all.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:47.799
You asked for a secluded rural house

00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:52.220
with the sun falling beautifully
from east to west

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:54.723
in the late afternoon.

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:56.617
I'll come back with more options.

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.226
Uh, also,

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:02.063
I want the space and lighting
to be as naturally beautiful as possible

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:05.650
so it contrasts
with the lead character's looming death.

00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:07.944
That'll feel even more heartbreaking.

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.662
Thank you, Ms. Chae.

00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:20.498
Can I ask why you brought me here?

00:33:20.582 --> 00:33:22.250
Mmm.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:25.837
Let's rehearse together here
until production begins.

00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:27.881
I'll be here whenever you want.

00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:30.937
That's how I'll repay you
for the sandwich.

00:33:31.468 --> 00:33:34.429
Me? Rehearsing here? With you?

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:37.307
Is it too much for you?

00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:41.228
No, I absolutely love it!

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:44.022
Make yourself at home.

00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:46.900
- Should we do some scenes?
- Yes!

00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:48.109
Oh!

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:49.527
Hmm?

00:33:52.155 --> 00:33:53.240
Actually,

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.160
could I get something to eat first?

00:33:58.078 --> 00:33:59.204
Oh, of course.

00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:02.415
I was so nervous at the thought
of coming to meet you

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:04.209
that I couldn't eat anything.

00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:06.711
I don't think my voice will come out right.

00:34:10.799 --> 00:34:12.717
Ma'am, please. They're rehearsing.

00:34:19.683 --> 00:34:20.892
Hello.

00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:23.061
You must be her.

00:34:23.812 --> 00:34:25.480
This is the CEO of our agency.

00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:27.899
Great to meet you, ma'am.

00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:31.861
I heard a lot about you from Seoyoung.
Make yourself comfortable.

00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:33.488
Seoyoung.

00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:37.617
- A minute?
- As you can see, I'm busy.

00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:41.371
Can I talk to you here, then?
I'm fine with that.

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:02.642
What were you thinking
when you brought her here?

00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:05.312
Figured I'd get to know my costar

00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:08.356
and get some practice in too.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.984
It's a win-win, really. No harm to that.

00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:12.277
Shut the hell up!

00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:25.582
You've got 11 lead roles and more
just waiting to hear from you.

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:27.709
Oh you're driving me insane.

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:29.628
What,

00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:31.171
you want her to act better?

00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:32.714
Make her successful?

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.299
Worry about yourself.

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:36.301
But I am doing well.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:37.385
Am I not?

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:38.970
Seriously…

00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:43.141
Doesn't it sting your pride even a little
to work with Lee Jeha again?

00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:46.853
I'm so sick of this.

00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:50.607
- What?
- I'm just running lines with my costar.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.777
If you pull this petty crap one more time
and try to interfere…

00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:56.905
Minhee,

00:35:57.405 --> 00:35:58.782
how long do we have left?

00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:00.867
Six months.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.245
Yes, then I'm walking out of here
with Minhee in six months.

00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:17.842
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:36:33.983 --> 00:36:34.984
Daeum?

00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:36.986
Daeum!

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:39.197
Are you okay?

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.281
I'll call an ambulance.

00:36:40.365 --> 00:36:42.867
P-People can't see…

00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:44.619
People can't see me like this.

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:48.248
- What...
- Hankuk National…

00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:50.500
Hankuk National University Hospital,
please.

00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:52.023
Hankuk National University Hospital.

00:36:56.297 --> 00:36:57.590
Daeum.

00:36:58.591 --> 00:36:59.843
Are you okay, Daeum?

00:37:01.302 --> 00:37:02.303
Oh, dear.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.859
Daeum!

00:37:15.942 --> 00:37:18.069
- Please wait here.
- Okay.

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:19.946
Daeum!

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.456
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:37:35.712 --> 00:37:38.339
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:49.017
You're here for Ms. Lee Daeum, right?

00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.686
Well, I'm not her family.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.062
I'm just here for today.

00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:54.981
I see.

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:58.193
We've given her a sedative,
but her condition isn't good.

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:00.278
She'll likely have to be admitted.

00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:02.322
Admitted?

00:38:03.406 --> 00:38:05.074
Does she need surgery or something?

00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:07.660
Surgery isn't really an option right now.

00:38:07.744 --> 00:38:09.746
Even admission is just my recommendation.

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:11.456
I doubt she would agree to it.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.291
Why's that?

00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:15.418
Sorry, she asked me not to say more.

00:38:15.502 --> 00:38:18.296
I think you should head home for today.

00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:19.964
I can't leave her here like this.

00:38:20.048 --> 00:38:21.341
You don't need to worry.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.281
So even Mr. Ji decided to join in.

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.077
And all the other crew too.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.621
Can't believe we got
all these people in one place.

00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:54.290
It's not even the main shoot
and they're still doing this.

00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:56.918
It feels kind of like fate.

00:38:57.502 --> 00:38:59.671
Well, our fate is riding on this shoot.

00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:01.840
Mr. Bu is also a miracle worker.

00:39:01.923 --> 00:39:05.593
From the look on his face lately,
I could tell things have been intense.

00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:08.263
That guy is always intense.

00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:14.269
By the way, what kind of
assistant director can't drive?

00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:17.021
I'm good at everything else, though.

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:20.942
Let's just
make sure the test shoot goes well.

00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:25.572
If anything comes up,
notify Chae Seoyoung's side.

00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:27.365
I'll handle Lee Daeum's side.

00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:28.908
I can handle her too, you know.

00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:30.201
I prefer doing it myself.

00:39:31.828 --> 00:39:32.954
Understood.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.039
- Have a safe ride back!
- Okay.

00:39:40.587 --> 00:39:42.130
LEE DAEUM

00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:47.010
DAEUM: I'M AT THE HOSPITAL

00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:49.971
<i>The person you are trying
to reach is unable to take your call</i>

00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:00.773
I figured you'd be here.

00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:07.238
Is my dad okay?

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:11.701
Worry about yourself, you brat.

00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:14.078
If you're out and about like today

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:17.582
and a seizure hits when no one's around,

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:19.375
you could really die.

00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:20.460
I'm not kidding.

00:40:21.753 --> 00:40:23.212
I mean

00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:24.631
I know.

00:40:24.714 --> 00:40:26.549
Don't you think I know that? Geez.

00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:28.176
But still,

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:31.930
if you're going to say something scary,
at least smile while you say it.

00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:35.767
Huh?

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.685
- Hang on.
- What is it?

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:39.354
That's Mr. Lee.

00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:40.730
Hold on.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.281
Hello?

00:40:50.365 --> 00:40:52.533
Mr. Lee. Over here.

00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:56.663
Over here! Can't you see me up here?

00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:59.374
No, don't turn around.
Turn back, I'm right here.

00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.668
<i>Yep, the hospital.</i>

00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:03.628
The skybridge in front of you.

00:41:06.506 --> 00:41:07.507
<i>Can't you see me?</i>

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.716
Right here!

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.927
Mr. Lee!

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.387
Someone's having a blast.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.472
Okay!

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.236
- Doc.
- What?

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.073
I'm heading out.

00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:35.159
Do whatever you want.

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:39.080
Off I go, then!

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:49.132
Did you have a routine checkup?

00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:53.428
Oh, yes. Routine checkup.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.513
Hmm.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.934
Grape juice! Just what I wanted.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.899
I got two for the price of one
on a "buy one, get one free" deal,

00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:08.317
but I'll let you have it.

00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:11.320
Look at you

00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:14.532
trying to sound noble.

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:17.952
I need you to rehearse
a scene for a test shoot.

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:22.457
Okay.

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.418
Normally,
test shoots are just to make sure

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:28.337
the setup works
before we do the real thing.

00:42:28.921 --> 00:42:32.133
But you should think of it
as the real thing.

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:35.303
You have to show everyone
you're the right person for this movie.

00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:37.346
I'll give it my all.

00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:39.557
I can do it.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.601
And this is a different issue, but…

00:42:43.519 --> 00:42:46.230
The number of people we'll have to lie to

00:42:46.314 --> 00:42:47.899
will grow by the dozens

00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:50.193
or even hundreds.

00:42:51.944 --> 00:42:53.362
I'll make sure to be careful.

00:42:53.446 --> 00:42:54.781
I'm just going back and forth

00:42:54.864 --> 00:42:57.200
between home
and the rehearsal studio anyway.

00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:58.868
Rehearsal studio?

00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.245
Uh, at Ms. Chae's agency.

00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:04.665
What for?

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:09.462
She's been really kind
to let me use the space at her agency,

00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:12.006
so we can rehearse
before production begins.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.051
All right. She's a good actress,
so watch and learn.

00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:16.886
Okay.

00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:18.763
Just be careful

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:21.974
no one finds out you're sick.

00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:31.651
You're here early.

00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:33.236
Hello, Ms. Chae.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.953
So, about last time…

00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:44.205
Oh, I'm not that curious to know.

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:46.040
- Pardon?
- When you're ready.

00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:49.377
I'll be here to listen
when you're ready to tell me later.

00:43:50.586 --> 00:43:52.505
Thank you for understanding.

00:43:52.588 --> 00:43:53.798
Shall we begin?

00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:56.926
Okay, Gyuwon slaps Junghwa.

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:59.220
And when I try to slap you back,

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.638
- you have to avoid it.
- Uh-huh.

00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:03.850
You see my hand in your peripheral vision?
When it's almost at your face…

00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:05.393
- Slap.
- Just like that.

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.829
- We have to trust each other.
- Ah.

00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:08.271
Can't you just slap me, though?

00:44:08.354 --> 00:44:11.357
Then I'd feel so bad.

00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:26.789
Hey, you're here.

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:29.250
Oh! Are those new shoes?

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.752
They look nice and comfy.

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:33.087
Can you make me some breakfast?

00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:35.381
Coming together.

00:44:36.048 --> 00:44:37.133
Breaking apart.

00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:41.095
Coming together.
I want to come together. Ta-da.

00:44:48.436 --> 00:44:50.438
Is he very busy in Seoul?

00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:52.982
<i>How is he, mentally and physically?</i>

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.069
Is he very busy in Seoul?

00:44:57.153 --> 00:44:59.030
How is he, mentally and physically?

00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:01.199
This space is too big.

00:45:01.282 --> 00:45:03.576
Is he very busy in Seoul?

00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:05.745
Is he very busy in Seoul?

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:15.546
Looks good.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.757
Thank you.

00:45:24.013 --> 00:45:26.015
DR. LEE JUNGHYO

00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:40.154
<i>Please, just stop! Please!</i>

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:43.616
I'd rather live half my time like this
than a full year in a hospital bed.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.831
So, Seoyoung hasn't had any new ad offers

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:53.542
since that article
about her in <i>Love in White</i> came out.

00:45:53.626 --> 00:45:54.627
Okay.

00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:58.276
- Looks like a rising star, no?
- Should I schedule a meeting?

00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:01.801
No?

00:46:01.884 --> 00:46:02.885
Let's go back

00:46:03.678 --> 00:46:05.388
to our roots for a change.

00:46:07.223 --> 00:46:09.016
So adorable.

00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:15.648
LOVE - FUNERAL SERVICES

00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:20.903
FUNERAL DIRECTOR, KIM JIHO

00:46:20.987 --> 00:46:22.196
Hey, Gyo!

00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:25.616
Let's go, your mom says it's time to eat.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.202
You start shooting tomorrow.
Are you nervous?

00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:30.579
Actually, I'm so nervous I'm freaking out.

00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:33.874
I'm worried if I'll have an episode again.

00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:36.794
Here.

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.338
Shoulders up.

00:46:39.422 --> 00:46:40.798
Stand tall.

00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:45.011
You go crush this. Forget everything else
and focus on acting.

00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.847
The one thing you want to do.

00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:50.016
Ready.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.059
- Action.
- Come on.

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:57.398
- We can do anything.
- Then what should we do now?

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.442
- Go and eat dinner!
- Turn around.

00:47:00.443 --> 00:47:01.610
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:07.533
Wow, it looks
like a completely different place.

00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:09.493
- For the full shot…
- Incredible.

00:47:09.577 --> 00:47:11.412
…I was thinking something like this.

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:14.165
I like it, but a little wider in the first cut.

00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:15.541
- I got it.
- Okay.

00:47:17.209 --> 00:47:18.461
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:20.880
You did a great job, sir.

00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:24.175
This must be an important test shoot.

00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:27.345
I've never had a test this tough in my life.

00:47:27.428 --> 00:47:28.846
Our fate depends on this.

00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:31.932
This has to go well
for you to keep working too.

00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:35.227
Hey! Daeum.

00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:37.646
- Hello.
- Daeum, you're here.

00:47:56.457 --> 00:47:57.666
Hello, Mr. Lee.

00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:04.423
This has to go well

00:48:04.507 --> 00:48:06.133
since this movie's fate rides on it.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.262
Tell me if it's too much pressure.

00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:11.430
Yeah, it is.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.641
Hmm.

00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:19.522
I heard you're letting Daeum
use your rehearsal studio.

00:48:20.523 --> 00:48:21.524
Yeah.

00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:23.943
I had to repay her for something.

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.737
What's that?

00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:29.407
Just something.

00:48:30.116 --> 00:48:32.243
Why? What's with all the questions?

00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:35.675
Use the production studio's space
from now on, where I can also be.

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:38.457
Why?

00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:41.877
You don't like me being alone with Daeum?

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:45.005
Why would you think that?

00:48:46.799 --> 00:48:47.800
Well, I mean…

00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:51.595
Okay, then. If that's what you'd prefer.

00:48:58.269 --> 00:49:00.271
P-People can't see…

00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:01.981
People can't see me like this.

00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:04.842
Just one more thing, Director Lee.

00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:06.861
You know…

00:49:07.403 --> 00:49:09.071
Yes? Tell me.

00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:15.619
Uh…

00:49:15.703 --> 00:49:16.704
Maybe later.

00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:19.248
It's nothing.

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:21.125
Let's head in.

00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:27.882
Don't be nervous.

00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:29.258
Just like we practiced.

00:49:29.758 --> 00:49:31.135
Okay, Ms. Chae.

00:49:31.844 --> 00:49:33.554
Break a leg.

00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:35.556
Break a leg.

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:36.724
I'll see you later.

00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:58.245
CAN I MAKE MOVIES AGAIN?

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:04.126
CAN I ACT AGAIN?

00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:13.344
CAN WE MAKE THIS MOVIE TOGETHER?

00:50:29.735 --> 00:50:32.029
- Speed!
- Test shoot, take one.

00:50:36.325 --> 00:50:37.409
Rolling.

00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:42.873
Ready.

00:50:45.334 --> 00:50:46.502
Action!

00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:29.420
Cut! Okay. That's good.

00:51:29.503 --> 00:51:32.047
She's good.

00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:35.259
That's a cut. Great job.

00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:42.516
I got the camera.

00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:45.394
Mr. Ji, how was it?

00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:47.605
It was great.

00:51:53.402 --> 00:51:54.695
Let's go check the playback.

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:57.156
Oh… Am I allowed to see it too?

00:51:57.239 --> 00:51:59.617
Of course. We all did it together.

00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:12.004
Let's just send it in now.

00:52:12.504 --> 00:52:13.922
When they see this,

00:52:14.006 --> 00:52:16.717
they're not gonna talk
about pulling investment

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.302
just because of a rookie actor.

00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:27.269
Enough with the side comments and go home.

00:52:27.353 --> 00:52:30.439
I'll bring a cut with proper editing,

00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:31.899
not just a rough cut.

00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:34.610
- Maybe some color grading too.
- Okay.

00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:38.572
Great work, everyone.

00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:40.366
Great work!

00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:41.450
Okay.

00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:43.369
- Good job.
- Well done.

00:52:43.452 --> 00:52:45.162
- Good work, sir.
- You did well today.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.917
Mr. Lee.

00:52:51.293 --> 00:52:53.128
You're still here. What is it?

00:52:54.296 --> 00:52:55.631
Is there a chance…

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.634
This movie might not happen because of me?

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.054
No. If the movie doesn't happen,

00:53:02.137 --> 00:53:03.681
that's because…

00:53:03.764 --> 00:53:05.724
Of both you and me.

00:53:06.308 --> 00:53:07.309
Sorry?

00:53:07.393 --> 00:53:10.513
What investor would trust a director
who's been out of the game for five years?

00:53:11.146 --> 00:53:14.024
That flashy test shoot we just did

00:53:14.108 --> 00:53:17.611
is a test for both Lee Daeum and Lee Jeha.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.618
I'm sorry. I should've done better.

00:53:26.745 --> 00:53:29.790
What happened to the cocky Lee Daeum
who said she could do it?

00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.710
Don't worry about it and go home.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.253
Just trust me.

00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:47.266
<i>You found her at an audition?</i>

00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:50.811
Yes. What do you think?

00:53:51.937 --> 00:53:53.397
It's fascinating

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.315
how new talents like this

00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.401
pop up out of nowhere every year.

00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:00.237
She really makes Seoyoung shine too.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.822
They really are great talents.

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.117
Did I dial down the red too much?

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.287
Ah, it's just Daeum's skin
that's very pale.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.289
She actually does look sick.

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:14.460
And with the way she performs,
it's hard not to believe it.

00:54:15.878 --> 00:54:19.173
Where on earth
did you find a rookie like that?

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.843
<i>Stop!</i>

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.136
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:26.722
<i>Let me go!</i>

00:54:26.805 --> 00:54:29.016
<i>Who are you to tell me what to do?</i>

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:33.771
<i>I…</i>

00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:36.440
<i>Have every right to destroy myself!</i>

00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:47.284
KIM JINYEO, MOVIE ACTOR

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.160
DO YOU KNOW JINYEO,
THE LEGEND OF 90S KOREAN CINEMA?

00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:55.417
KIM JINYEO'S PROFILE

00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:56.644
FROM EXTRA TO
THE CENTER OF CHUNGMURO,

00:54:56.668 --> 00:54:58.268
HOW SHE BECAME
"THE FACE OF A GENERATION"

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:02.007
<i>Is he very busy in Seoul?</i>

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.676
Spare me the pity party.
I'm done watching this.

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.887
You know where Hyunsang is, don't you?

00:55:07.554 --> 00:55:09.097
Aren't you dying soon?

00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:11.391
Honestly, that's low.

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.435
Even for you.

00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:39.127
Just one scene.

00:55:39.211 --> 00:55:41.922
This one scene explains everything.

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:43.173
Lee Daeum?

00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:46.552
Mm-hmm. Where did you manage
to find an actress like that?

00:55:47.052 --> 00:55:51.139
This is more than enough
to convince our old guards.

00:55:52.558 --> 00:55:53.767
But, you know,

00:55:54.893 --> 00:55:57.020
the actress who played Gyuwon
in the original.

00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:59.147
She's been retired for a while, right?

00:56:00.774 --> 00:56:02.109
Yes. What about her?

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:05.028
Just curious what she's been up to lately.

00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:07.489
What kind of lives

00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:10.075
do these female leads live
after the movie ends?

00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:12.828
Makes you wonder, no?

00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:16.582
You got the DP who wasn't available,

00:56:17.457 --> 00:56:19.793
cast a top actress in a supporting role,

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:21.795
pulled out a superstar rookie,

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.422
and even convinced the investors.

00:56:23.505 --> 00:56:26.008
You were right
when you said I wouldn't regret this.

00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:29.845
You should head back.
I have somewhere to be.

00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:31.197
Sure, you pulled an all-nighter.

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.306
Seungwon.

00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.266
What is it?

00:56:37.436 --> 00:56:38.478
Thanks.

00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:41.315
Well, now…

00:56:50.532 --> 00:56:52.367
Where are you? Are you free right now?

00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:57.080
<i>I'm on my way to the hospital
to get the results from my checkup.</i>

00:56:58.415 --> 00:57:00.834
I'll head to the hospital.
Let's talk for a second.

00:57:08.216 --> 00:57:09.301
Uh…

00:57:09.384 --> 00:57:11.094
So, here's the thing

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.430
Mr. Lee,

00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.266
is there something wrong?

00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:18.894
You're going to be

00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:21.772
this movie's lead for real.

00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:23.815
What?

00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.525
We got the investment.

00:57:26.568 --> 00:57:28.278
Thanks to that one scene you did.

00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:32.532
You accomplished it yourself.

00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:36.036
Thank you.

00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:39.247
Are you serious?

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.008
I can't believe it!

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.604
That was the Hollywood way

00:58:04.356 --> 00:58:05.482
of saying thank you.

00:58:08.026 --> 00:58:09.361
Great job.

00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:14.032
Uh…

00:58:14.116 --> 00:58:15.117
Also

00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:17.828
I didn't see a set location

00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:20.664
for the scene
where Gyuwon gives up on life

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.041
but ends up finding hope.

00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:25.127
That's because I couldn't find one for it.

00:58:27.713 --> 00:58:28.815
Can I make a recommendation?

00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:31.758
- No. Just use that time to rehearse.
- Mmm.

00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:34.678
Rehearsal is rehearsal.
Recommendation is recommendation.

00:58:37.889 --> 00:58:38.890
Follow me.

00:58:40.892 --> 00:58:42.144
Follow, follow me!

00:58:43.437 --> 00:58:44.521
Mr. Lee!

00:58:45.272 --> 00:58:47.566
Follow, follow me!

00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.786
Ta-da!

00:59:01.496 --> 00:59:02.873
This is the place.

00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:11.423
Well, it'd be perfect
for a hospital promo video.

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.009
Not here.

00:59:18.889 --> 00:59:20.265
Down there.

00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:32.068
Um…

00:59:52.005 --> 00:59:53.840
When you're in the hospital long enough,

00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:56.343
there are days that feel unbearable.

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.806
Whenever that happened,
I'd stand right here and look outside.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:05.268
I thought about
how this is just a glass window,

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.687
but life could be so different beyond it.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:17.364
If Gyuwon were to stand here
and look out like this,

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.366
she'd actually want to live.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.038
Just a few days ago,

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:28.583
I was going around
making funeral plans for myself.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:32.462
But then suddenly,
I found myself way outside over there.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.841
This film

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.885
has that kind of power, at least for me.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:45.767
While Gyuwon is looking down
at the world like this in the movie,

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.937
she spots someone outside.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.107
Someone who's on that side of the world

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.902
walks by, happens to look up,

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.573
and smiles at Gyuwon.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:05.370
Do you know what would happen to her then?

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.039
What would happen?

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:10.709
She'd fall apart

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.587
because she wants to live so badly.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:17.966
But death just keeps chasing her.

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:22.178
And she'd go, "Okay, fine.
If this is my fate, I get it."

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.890
"But let me just live a little first!"

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.184
Then try to outrun death
with everything she's got.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.688
Even if it only buys her a second.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:51.958
I quite like this spot.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:55.462
Really?

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.380
In that case,

01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:01.051
shouldn't I get paid
for scouting the best location?

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.387
Calm down. You have to book it,
or it doesn't count.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:08.016
What? Of course
I was going to book it for you too!

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:11.144
This is my turf, you know.

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:14.105
Booking this spot
would be a piece of cake.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.067
No problem at all.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.218
Good morning, Daeum!

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.469
Remember me?

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.471
Uh, hello.

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.682
I've been waiting for you.

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.434
- Sorry?
- I know you're here for a meeting,

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:53.603
but how about a cup of tea with me first?

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:58.984
It's been a while
since my agency brought on a new face.

01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:02.112
There's no one
who feels genuine these days.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:03.905
I don't sign just anybody, you know.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.870
I'm not planning to sign
with an agency, ma'am.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.414
Why not?

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.332
You don't like us?

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:16.835
You didn't even hear the offer.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:20.171
Any offer doesn't matter, actually.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.966
This movie is enough for me, that's all.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:25.301
I honestly have no goals after this.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.014
You land a role that everybody wants,

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:30.515
and you have no goal?

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.726
You know,

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.687
that's very insulting
to actors who are desperate for a chance.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.816
I'm sorry.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.569
Let's just say it's personal reasons.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:45.113
No need to apologize to me.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:49.034
Did the director
tell you not to sign anything?

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.536
No, he's not the type to do that.

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:54.581
Around here, there's no "type"
who'd do or not do anything.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.082
That's just how this industry is.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.877
Director Lee is…

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:02.672
Well…

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:05.467
You can trust him as a director,

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:09.095
but don't trust him too much as a person.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.852
I'm going to trust him more than anyone.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:20.148
Looks like it's time for my meeting.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.400
I have to run.

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:24.110
I'm sorry.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.979
<i>This is a secret, but I'm making
this film because I don't really know.</i>

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.438
<i>Don't know what?</i>

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:46.526
What it's like to love someone.

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:53.825
What is Seoyoung to you?

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:58.663
She's a great actress who taught me
something I didn't know very well.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.628
<i>- Are you happy now?
- So happy I could die.</i>

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:09.007
<i>You listen to me.
I'm not letting you end up like that.</i>

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:10.717
Dad

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.637
I'm dying.

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:23.146
<i>Why are you asking if Daeum is sick?</i>

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.733
<i>You really care about Daeum, huh?</i>

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.903
<i>I just need her.</i>

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.322
<i>That's all.</i>

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.908
