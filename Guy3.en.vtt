00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.960
The Nice Guy

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.254
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.547
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.714
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.091
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:53.053
It's my business, too.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.808
Who do you think will have to pay back
the money you borrow from him?

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.185
You know how hard I'll have to work
to make up for it.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.187
- You ungrateful--
- It's because of you...

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.234
that I got into this line of work.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.291
Sir.

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.293
Sir?

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:25.460
Oh, yes.

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:26.545
Right.

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:29.298
So, what did you want to see me about?

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.134
Oh, well...

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:37.055
I came downtown for some business
and decided to stop by and see you.

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.140
I see.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.393
Is there something you wanted to tell me?

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.146
Well...

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:48.025
Take good care of Seokcheol.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.153
Don't shove him around too much, okay?

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.237
Sure.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:54.865
I'll get going then.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:55.949
Sir, wait a minute.

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:03.457
You could get yourself a new suit,
and take Daegi out for a meal sometime.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.292
No, take it back. I'm good. Bye.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.502
- Wait, sir.
- No, no. I'm leaving.

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:08.754
- Wait!
- No, thanks. Bye.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.714
Sir!

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:11.798
Sir...

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.880
Are you finding it difficult to send money
to my family every month?

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:54.800
No, sir. I'm only keeping my promise.

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.553
I'll probably be sentenced
to at least 10 years in prison.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.306
You know my son, right?

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.974
You mean, Seokcheol?

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.894
Give him a job at your company.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.649
The money you send to my house
can be considered as his salary.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.025
Does that work for you?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.861
Welcome back.

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.536
This isn't yours. It's mine.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.334
How carefree of you,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.503
worrying about skincare
at a time like this.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.548
Must be nice, huh?

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.009
Why are you drunk?

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.137
That's none of your business.

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:23.972
You know,

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.685
during the past five years
of my life as a nurse,

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.647
I've often wondered
why my life is the way it is.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.483
Why do I...

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:39.237
Why do I always have problems
like a patient in emergency care?

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.823
What are you talking about?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.451
Well, the thing is...

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.369
Today...

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.749
I got my heart broken.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.668
Hold on.

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:55.712
Did something happen?

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.051
Dr. Jang,
do you have a girlfriend?

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.139
- Do you?
- Uh...

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:07.808
Yes, well...

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.186
I don't.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.564
That guy is ridiculous.

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:19.528
So, he wants to go to a piano concert
with that hospital director's daughter?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.697
He was crazy about you
when he was younger.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.533
He's too good for you
now that he's a doctor?

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:29.454
Honestly speaking, if our family
had supported you in your studies,

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:30.831
you wouldn't be a nurse.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.499
You would've easily become a doctor.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.710
Are you looking down on my job?

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:37.838
No, that's not what I'm saying.

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:41.883
Hey, you should be grateful
to have me side with you.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.718
I never asked you to side with me.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:47.472
If you care about me so much,
why are you still staying in my house?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.808
You should find a way to move on.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.362
Where are you going?

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.030
To bed.

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:10.245
- Oh, sorry, I'll take them off.
- Don't.

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.455
You can keep them on.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.443

SEOKCHEOL

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:56.458
- Hi. Where are you?
- <i>At home.</i>

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.628
<i>- Just thought I'd call and say hi.</i>

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.463
I'm going to try auditioning again.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:02.756
<i>Really?</i>

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.799
Yes, I'm going to give it another try.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.844
This time,
it'll be at a jazz bar in Myoungsan City.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.262
I went and checked it out.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.264
It has a nice vibe, and they pay well.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.769
I haven't decided on what song I'll sing
for the audition.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.104
- Will you listen and help me pick one?
<i>- Sure.</i>

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.857
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
- Hang on a second.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.324
All right, this is number one.

The Nice Guy

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.391
Jeez!

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.935
You startled me. What are you doing here?

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.813
Seokcheol didn't come home last night.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.065
He didn't tell me he'd be staying out.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.316
Did he tell you?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.526
No.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.571
It's not like him to do that.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.281
Did you try calling him?

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.951
There's no need. He's a grown-up.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.258
Yes, I had to work late,
so I slept at a sauna last night.

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:11.926
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.054
You could've at least left us a text.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:15.889
I'll do that next time.

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.891
Rest up. I'm on my way to work now.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.142
<i>I see. Bye.</i>

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.268
<i>Wait, Seokcheol.</i>

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:21.936
What?

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.855
Any news about Seokkyung yet?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.192
Well...

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.653
I think we're getting close.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.072
We'll find her soon.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.950
I dreamt about her last night.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:41.998
<i>That brat was alone in the kitchen,</i>
<i>eating kimchi with her hands.</i>

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:46.086
I told her it'd be too salty on its own,
and handed her a bowl of steamed rice.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:48.505
Then she was gone.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.759
<i>Goodness.</i>
<i>I hope she's not skipping any meals.</i>

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.135
She won't be, Mom.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.971
I bet she's well-fed,
and sleeps just fine. Don't worry.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.350
You're right.
She does what she wants in life.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.893
She won't starve to death.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.686
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.899
Damn it...

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.402
Grandma!

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.238
Let's go to the playground.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.614
Let's play on the slide.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:17.534
Goodness, again? We did that yesterday.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.203
Come on, Grandma. I want to go.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.347
I heard your father visited yesterday.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.432
Yes. Who told you?

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.434
The Chairman.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.564
Didn't he say anything else about it?

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.357
Like what?

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:51.359
Like, what they spoke about.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.778
Oh.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.447
He said your father
just stopped by for a bit.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.243
That's it? Did he say anything else?

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.537
No... Oh, right.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.291
The Chairman asked me to give this to you.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:08.793
What is it?

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:12.589
He meant to give it to your father
so he could buy some new clothes,

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.465
but he declined it and left.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:23.016
Well, if my father didn't take it,
I won't either.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.101
- You can keep it.
- What are you...

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.478
Fine, I'll take it.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.899
Don't ask again.
And hide it before I change my mind.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.192
Okay, thank you.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:33.359
No takebacks.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.494
That's good. Drink it up
if it makes you feel better.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:52.295
Seokcheol went through a lot
while you were in prison.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:54.297
At such a young age, too.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.551
Seeing his face yesterday

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.553
reminded me of the past.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.350
Once, when he was in elementary school,
I visited his school.

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.686
I was all dressed up,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.898
but he wouldn't even look at me.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.775
Really?

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.569
I wondered what was wrong with him.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:23.701
Then suddenly, with a long face,
he pushed me and told me to go home.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.083
He knew what his father did for a living.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:32.460
He was only a child,

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.880
and I wronged him in so many ways.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:41.261
Goodness. You're not as strong
as you used to be.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:47.016
Listen, just sit down with Seokcheol
and tell him how you feel.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.353
I'm sure he'll understand
if you explained things to him.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.814
I'd be a fool...

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.653
to expect him to understand me.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.116
Goodness.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.287


00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.464
SIS FROM HOUSE

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.307
Oh, I can't help it.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.097
Look at me.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.267
Gosh, what is this?

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.022
Hyeonggeun.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.444
Aren't you tired?

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.905
- Mom...
- Good. Gosh. Go on.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:29.035
Go up. Go up.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.249
One last time, then let's go home, okay?
I'm tired.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:37.960
What is it?

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:39.545
Hyeonggeun.

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.756
Hyeonggeun, come down.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.591
Come down. Let's go home. Good boy.

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:47.178
Goodness.

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.763
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.768
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:58.272
Let's go home and eat something yummy.
What should we have?

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.191
- Jjajangmyeon?
- Jjajangmyeon?

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:02.652
All right. Jjajangmyeon, it is.

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:06.823
Let's see,
if we want to make jjajangmyeon...

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.202
Mom?

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:29.178
Hyeonggeun, where are you going? Stop.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.848
Hey, where are you going?

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.182
- Oh, no.
- Jeez.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.314
Gosh, that brat.

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.739
Wait. Slow down, dear.
You don't want to trip and fall.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:49.824
Goodness.

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:00.543
Mom!

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.545
Mom!

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.473
Oh, no! Hyeonggeun!

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.545
Wait. He shouldn't go that way.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.798
Jeez, where did Mom go?

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.175
Hyeonggeun!

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.969
Gosh, where is he? Hyeonggeun!

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:53.888
Hyeonggeun. Oh, no.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.141
No, Hyeonggeun. No.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.023
Hyeonggeun!

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.319
Mommy?

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.155
- Huh?
- You're my mom, aren't you?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.241
What?

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.204
No. I'm not your mom.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:20.915
Then, how do you know my name?

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.127
No, Hyeonggeun. No.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.963
No, you're right.

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:31.884
You're right. It's your mom.

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.804
So, don't cry. Stop crying.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.932
I knew it was you.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.350
Yes, it's me.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.228
Hyeonggeun,

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.730
promise me something.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:49.610
Don't tell your grandma
that you met me here.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:50.778
- Okay?
- Why?

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:53.155
Because...

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.450
Is it because you're afraid
Grandpa will beat you up?

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.329
Yes, he'll beat me up.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:05.418
So, you need to protect me, okay?

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.421
Will you keep our little secret, hmm?

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.592
I'll come back to see you for sure.

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.469
I promise.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.023
Hurry to your grandma.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:28.774
Okay?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.484
There. Hurry on.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.653
Go.

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:34.989
Hurry.

00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:37.742
Go.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.247
Hyeonggeun! Goodness.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.167
Gosh, where have you been?

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.045
I thought I lost you.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.297
Let's hurry home. Gosh.

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:56.844
Come on.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:18:59.889
- It's spring now.
- Yes.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.733
I hope the construction
resumes soon.

00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:14.028
- Do you have the contract?
- Yes, of course.

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.489
I'm going to keep it safe with me.

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.575
It's a draft, so make sure you read it

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.745
and negotiate a few things in person
with my boss.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.456
Sure, I'll have it done right away.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:30.294
You know, I feel reassured
every time I see Mr. Seokcheol.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.545
Thank you.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:35.424
I hope you're aware that
he's the one who made this deal possible.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:38.427
Of course we are.
He's the trump card of our company.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.471
I'm reassured to have him too.

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:43.432
Oh, right.
We'll take a look around the site, sir.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.642
Why don't you go in?

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:47.144
- Sure. Take your time.
- Okay.

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.108
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.403
Seokcheol.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.655
You've done a great job.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:02.118
If the Chairman settles the contract
with them today,

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:03.911
we're going out for drinks.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:07.998
Looking at the scale here,

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:11.502
the profit is gonna be much bigger
than with the District Three deal.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:14.296
Come on, you can't compare the two.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.551
But, yes, this will be three times
more profitable than District Three.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.137
In that case,

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:25.766
could I get an advance,
considering what I did?

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.395
Don't tell me you'll quit
after taking the money.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.273
I'll make sure my work here is done,
don't worry.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.067
So, how much do you need?

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.280
It's a big amount.

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.407
How big? 10 million won?

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:43.492
About...

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.495
Jeez! 100 million won.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:49.999
That much?

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.296
That's a little too much.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:58.466
I don't know
how to bring it up with the Chairman.

00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:02.845
Anyway, why do you suddenly need
that much money?

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.307
I have my reasons.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.977
Besides, I've never asked you
for anything before.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:13.564
Gosh, that punk.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.108
What a nuisance.

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:17.693
100 million won.

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:19.904
Jeez, that's a big amount.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.115
MYOUNGSAN HOSPITAL

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.826
Well, nothing is too serious.
Just a simple sprain.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.746
I'll prescribe meds for three days.
Make sure you don't skip any.

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:30.790
- And don't exert yourself.
- I see.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.374
Give her an injection.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:33.959
- Yes.
- Thank you, Doctor.

00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:35.503
- This way, please.
- Okay.

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:37.963
Ms. Seokhee.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:39.715
Can we talk for a moment?

00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:46.597
What is it?

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.432
Seokhee.

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:52.520
Please don't misunderstand me.

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:55.898
What would I do with her daughter
when I already have you?

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.526
Date her or something?

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:02.071
She brought her daughter over yesterday

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:05.533
and asked me right to my face,
so I couldn't flat-out say no.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.662
And that piano concert... Listen.

00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:11.956
I'm not going.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.292
I told her that
I forgot I had a conference to attend

00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:16.794
and that I couldn't make it.

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:21.090
Did you have to make an excuse like that?

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:24.844
Come on, you know what she's like.
You wouldn't want to get on her bad side.

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:27.596
Remember what happened the other day
with Dr. Jang Jonghoon?

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.933
She sent him off to another hospital
because he didn't greet her.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.103
I don't want to be separated from you.

00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:35.604
Hmm?

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.690
Come on.

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:41.610
Let's go out for a nice meal later,
what do you say?

00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:43.279
Hmm?

00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:47.366
You can go alone.

00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:49.493
Seokhee.

00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:54.248
Goodness.

00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:56.834
Gosh.

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:08.512
Next is...

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:11.891
Great! Lucky me.

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.727
Nice!

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:17.187
You shouldn't play cards here.

00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:20.316
What are you doing? Give them back.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:23.235
I'm confiscating them.
Do it after you're discharged.

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:24.820
I'm not leaving.

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:28.449
My life's in danger. I can't even go home.

00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:30.910
No one has that much time to kill.

00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:33.412
House Jang thinks
she lost your sister because of me.

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:34.872
She wants me to pay the price.

00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:36.957
They're looking for me!

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:39.752
So what? You can't live here forever.

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:41.629
You and your brother
got me into this mess.

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:43.964
How shameless of you.

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:47.217
Hey, give me the cards.

00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:48.344
No, I don't want to.

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.678
That little...

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.140
Damn it.

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.391
This is annoying.

00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.262
Do I have high blood pressure?

00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:33.555
No, it's normal.

00:24:43.691 --> 00:24:45.651
Have you rested enough?

00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:46.860
Yes.

00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:49.989
I see. Did you have nightmares?

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.157
No... I mean, yes...

00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:57.621
You know, we went through
every hospital in this neighborhood

00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:58.914
just to find you.

00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:04.128
I know you.
You're that lady from the gambling house.

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:06.964
- Remember me?
- I do.

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:11.385
You left your car with me
during the last Chuseok and got it back.

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:12.886
You have a good memory.

00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:18.892
These boys are here
to help you get discharged.

00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:20.936
I'm not supposed to get discharged today.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.898
I know. But you have to get discharged.

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:27.484
- Hey, Halibut.
- Yes, sir.

00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:29.778
- Let's help her pack up and leave.
- Yes, sir.

00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:31.155
Move aside, please.

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:33.073
What are you doing?

00:25:33.157 --> 00:25:36.118
She can't just leave
without the doctor's permission.

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.786
What are you talking about?

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.955
The patient wants to leave

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:42.750
due to her delicate family situation.

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:45.127
But I need more treatment.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.712
Shut it, you wench.

00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:49.506
You're going to help me find Seokkyung.

00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:53.719
Oh, were you checking your blood pressure?

00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:55.596
How nice.

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.348
Wait. My blood isn't circulating.

00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:00.392
Gosh, this...

00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:02.436
Ms. Park, we have a problem.

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:06.565
Some strange people came to Room 2230.
They're trying to take Go Jeongnim away!

00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:07.858
- Hmm?
- What?

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.528
- Help!
- Where are you going?

00:26:11.612 --> 00:26:13.947
- Damn you.
- What do you think you're doing?

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.491
Seokhee--

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.535
Miss, don't bother. Just go away.

00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:21.497
- Who are you to order me around?
- Wait.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.875
Oh, my goodness!

00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:28.462
Hey. Aren't you that witch
who barged into our house?

00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:30.798
You're right.
She's the one who caused the mess.

00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:33.383
- Isn't she?
- Oh, I see. You're that lady.

00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.094
You even brought your underlings.

00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:36.428
And you're alone.

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:40.140
You have no right to take our patient
without our permission.

00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:44.520
- Now leave, all of you.
- We'll be taking her with us. So, move.

00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:49.316
Hey. I said, move!

00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:00.953
Excuse me.

00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:04.039
Who are you to cause a scene
here at the hospital?

00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:05.749
Mister, go back inside.

00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:12.339
Ma'am, come here.

00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:15.300
See? I told you
I couldn't just leave like that.

00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:16.969
Come here, wench.

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:22.140
What kind of weird hospital is this?

00:27:22.224 --> 00:27:25.477
The patient wants to leave the hospital.

00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:26.603
Why won't you let her?

00:27:26.687 --> 00:27:28.480
She must follow the proper procedure.

00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:30.190
Leave the patient here and go.

00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:33.944
- Get out.
- Get off me!

00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:36.905
Doctor, are you okay?

00:27:37.948 --> 00:27:40.742
Did you people just assault the doctor?

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:42.953
Damn. He fell down on his own.

00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:45.414
What? You want me to help you fall too?

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:47.291
Huh? Shall I?

00:27:47.374 --> 00:27:49.001
You cheeky little--

00:27:50.544 --> 00:27:52.504
Hey.

00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:54.965
It actually works?

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:56.049
Why you little...

00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:10.355
My nose!

00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:15.485
Blood?

00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:17.821
A nosebleed.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.074
- Blood.
- Blood.

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:23.243
Do you want one too?

00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:25.871
Ahhh! No, no, wait...

00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:27.623
What's wrong with you?

00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:30.208
Why...

00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:31.668
Force all of these people out.

00:28:31.752 --> 00:28:33.795
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:35.631
- Not me.
- Come on.

00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:38.175
No, not me. I'm a patient, really.

00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:39.718
I'm not dangerous. Look.

00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:40.802
That minx!

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:41.887
Hey, you minx...

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.473
Just you wait and see!

00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:47.851
Seokhee, you're so cool.

00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:49.937
Thanks, Seokhee!

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.196
I'm all right.
I might get a slight bruise.

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:01.698
No, it's not a slight bruise.

00:29:02.616 --> 00:29:04.910
You got a bump. Goodness.

00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.745
Why did you have to get involved?

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:09.456
Wait.

00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:13.210
- What is it?
- Your forehead seems unusual.

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:14.670
It's rock-hard.

00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:18.131
I mean, it's a good thing.

00:29:18.215 --> 00:29:20.634
It protects your brain better.

00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:25.430
Don't let me down, okay?

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.557
Of course not.

00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:30.060
You really don't trust me?

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:32.437
My goodness.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.483
How could you even compare yourself
to that woman's daughter?

00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:43.907
If you behave like that again,
I'll take action for real.

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:45.867
Got it.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.954
I promise I won't do it.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.750
But you shouldn't
headbutt people again, okay?

00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:55.419
You could get hurt.

00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:57.212
You're pretty in every way,

00:29:57.713 --> 00:30:00.298
but your forehead is the prettiest of all.

00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:04.428
Okay, I'll stop headbutting people.

00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:07.180
Come here.

00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.349
What are you doing?

00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:11.101
Don't move.

00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:12.352
It tickles.

00:30:12.436 --> 00:30:15.147
- This will help it heal.
- It tickles.

00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:18.942
Wait.

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:20.944
Stay there.

00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:22.904
What are you closing
the curtains for?

00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:25.615
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:29.453
Good job.

00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:31.913
- Thank you, sir.
- So, did you book a table?

00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:33.165
Yes, sir.

00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:34.958
At a quiet restaurant.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.461
Okay, okay.

00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:40.380
Uh, sir, I have something to tell you.

00:30:40.464 --> 00:30:41.631
What is it?

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:47.429
Seokcheol wants a personal incentive
for his work.

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:48.847
An incentive?

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.183
Well, he rarely asks for money.

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:53.560
I guess he needs it for an urgent reason.

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:55.312
- How much?
- At least...

00:30:56.646 --> 00:30:57.856
100 million won.

00:30:58.607 --> 00:30:59.858
- 100 million won?
- Yes.

00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:04.071
I thought it was a little too much,
so I told him off.

00:31:04.154 --> 00:31:06.448
I mean, 100 million won
is a lot of money--

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.116
Tell him I said okay.

00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:10.952
Pardon me?

00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:15.165
That punk, Taehoon, left because of money.

00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:17.084
I don't want that to happen again.

00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:18.418
Tell him I'll give him the money.

00:31:19.628 --> 00:31:20.796
Don't let him...

00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:23.882
think otherwise.

00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:25.342
Yes, sir.

00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:33.058
SAMJUN E&amp;C

00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:45.487
Sir, everything's set up.

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:48.156
Changsoo is cunning like a fox.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.367
Don't ask the boys to do it.
Do it yourself.

00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:52.285
Yes, sir.

00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:53.787
Sir,

00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:57.707
shouldn't we do something
about Park Seokcheol too?

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.960
Honestly, without him there--

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.128
Just do what you're told.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:07.175
He shouldn't be involved with Changsoo.

00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:10.595
Yes, sir.

00:33:27.214 --> 00:33:30.467
The Chairman and Sangyeol
will be here soon.

00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:33.970
Why?

00:33:35.055 --> 00:33:36.681
Let them come pay their condolences.

00:33:37.891 --> 00:33:39.100
Talk it out with them.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.645
- After the funeral.
- Call them.

00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:43.605
Tell them not to come.

00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:52.864
Damn it. How diligent of them.

00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:54.950
Taehoon.

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.876
Don't take their money.

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:10.715
Taehoon.

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:12.717
If we do,

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.137
I'll only feel worse about my sister.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.226
Sir.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.104
My little sister is in there.

00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:26.106
I mean, Seoyeon.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.403
She died because we couldn't get
30 million won for her surgery.

00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:35.740
That 30 million won
that you accused me of pocketing,

00:34:36.992 --> 00:34:38.868
it was for my sister's surgery.

00:34:41.288 --> 00:34:42.289
Changsoo.

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.040
That's enough.

00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:46.126
Changsoo!

00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:47.252
Punk.

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:48.712
Be respectful towards him.

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:51.589
Listen, I get it!
I know it's hard, but be polite--

00:34:51.673 --> 00:34:54.217
- Why should I be polite to him, huh?
- Taehoon! Don't!

00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:55.343
- You little...
- Taehoon!

00:34:55.427 --> 00:34:56.720
- Because of you, Seoyeon...
- Stop!

00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:58.722
Snap out of it, punk.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.315
Let's go, Sangyeol.

00:35:08.398 --> 00:35:09.399
CONDOLENCES

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.444
Take it back.

00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:16.448
Take it back.

00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.742
Take it all back.

00:35:19.492 --> 00:35:22.495
Take it back, you damn thug!

00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.957
Get out. All you thugs, go.

00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:29.461
Get out, you damn thugs! Go!

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.880
Get out, you damn thugs!

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:33.798
Go!

00:35:34.674 --> 00:35:35.675
Go!

00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.803
You thugs, go!

00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:39.888
Get out now!

00:35:58.156 --> 00:35:59.366
Why are you still here?

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:05.038
You did well.

00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:07.624
You did what you had to do to feel better.

00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:10.126
Those scumbags

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.047
had three bowls of yukgaejang each.

00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:16.925
How many bowls did you have?

00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:20.095
Not even one.

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:21.471
Because you went nuts.

00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:25.308
Sorry.

00:36:25.392 --> 00:36:26.685
You can have some now.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.687
You can have four bowls.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.733
I won't mind.

00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:37.779
You're not like those people.

00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:47.580
Seokcheol.

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:52.335
Thanks for being by my side.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.468
Come on, man. Don't be silly.

00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:05.849
I know how much you adore Seokhee.

00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:07.267
I can relate to that.

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:16.693
I'm going to quit.

00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:24.993
Will you leave with me?

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:04.783
SANGYEOL

00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:09.704
Hello?

00:38:09.788 --> 00:38:11.831
<i>Hey, Seokcheol.</i>

00:38:11.915 --> 00:38:13.833
<i>- He said yes.</i>
- What do you mean?

00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:16.461
It's about the money you asked for, punk.
You asked for money.

00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:23.593
<i>I told the Chairman</i>
<i>that you deserved at least 100 million won</i>

00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:25.386
<i>for the work you did for us,</i>

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.721
<i>and he said okay.</i>

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:28.640
- Are you sure?
<i>- Yes, you punk.</i>

00:38:28.723 --> 00:38:31.935
<i>- The Chairman wasn't so happy, but I--</i>

00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:33.853
Hello? Hey, Seokcheol.

00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:35.605
Hello? Seok...

00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:38.691
I wasn't even done talking,
and he hung up on me.

00:38:38.775 --> 00:38:40.360
That rude punk.

00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:26.072
Next person, please get ready.

00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:27.156
Yes.

00:39:35.665 --> 00:39:38.251
Wait. What are you doing there?

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:42.005
You should come and sing at the mic,
not sit in front of the piano.

00:39:42.088 --> 00:39:43.298
No backing track?

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.508
I'll play the piano
without the backing track--

00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:46.593
We don't want that.

00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:48.553
It's clearly mentioned
in the audition guidelines.

00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:51.389
If you don't have a backing track,
please leave.

00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:54.267
She wants to play the music herself.
Why don't we let her do it?

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.019
We can see how good she is.

00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:01.983
What's your name?

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:03.818
It's Kang Miyoung.

00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:06.738
"Kang Miyoung."
Even her name's so... Tsk!

00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:08.156
Anyway, start playing.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.949
Let's get it over with, all right?

00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:20.460
<i>- ♪ I'll write you a letter ♪</i>

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:27.634
<i>♪ And tell you everything</i>
<i>about how I feel ♪</i>

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.890
<i>♪ I will write to you ♪</i>

00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:40.563
<i>- ♪ About my unchanging heart ♪</i>

00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:48.863
<i>- ♪ I wished upon a star ♪</i>

00:40:51.574 --> 00:40:55.995
♪ I bet everything I had ♪

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:03.044
<i>♪ That I'd show you ♪</i>

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:08.800
<i>♪ How endless my love for you is ♪</i>

00:41:09.842 --> 00:41:11.469
Stop.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.263
That's enough. Next person.

00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:16.766
Wait, sir. Why? She's good.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:19.060
No, she isn't.

00:41:19.686 --> 00:41:22.230
Her voice doesn't have
that emotional quality, you know?

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:24.232
- All right, next.
- Hold on, sir.

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:27.193
Aren't you being too biased
about this audition?

00:41:27.777 --> 00:41:28.778
Excuse me?

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.908
Look, I'm the manager here.

00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:36.285
If I say no, it's a no. Got it?

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:38.955
Excuse me.

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:42.000
Does that mean I'm disqualified, then?

00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.292
Yes, you are.

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:47.755
We don't have all day.
Hurry up and get off the stage.

00:41:52.051 --> 00:41:54.053
- Take good care of your voices.
- Yes, sir.

00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:55.138
See you.

00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:56.681
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:59.267
Minseo.
Tell your father I said hello.

00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:03.271
- Thank you.
- No problem. Bye.

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:08.067
Well, I'd like to ask you something.

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.947
I'm a little busy right now.

00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:16.492
What is it? Go on.

00:42:16.576 --> 00:42:19.245
I want to know why I didn't make it.

00:42:21.289 --> 00:42:24.042
Because you weren't good enough.
Why bother asking me?

00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:26.294
You gave the job
to people who sang off-key.

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:27.420
So, why didn't I...

00:42:27.503 --> 00:42:31.549
Do I need to give you
technical reasons or something?

00:42:33.468 --> 00:42:35.178
Well, you are... How should I put it?

00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:38.473
- Your bending needs work.
- "Bending"?

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:42.435
Yes, like in African-American music.
You don't know what I'm talking about?

00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:44.145
You mean, vibrato?

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:45.646
Yes, that. So, you know.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.023
You already know, so why ask me?

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:51.736
Anyway, I'm busy,
so stop pushing me and get out of here.

00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:54.030
If that's the reason,

00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:56.741
could you give me one more chance?

00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:08.586
AUDITION FOR BANDS AND SOLO ARTISTS

00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:34.904
My goal is to bring my mom back
from the nursing home.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.282
She hates that place, you know.

00:43:38.366 --> 00:43:39.867
And I hate leaving her there.

00:43:40.827 --> 00:43:41.828
I see.

00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:44.455
Would you feel the same
if you were in my situation?

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:46.457
I mean, this is how it is with families.

00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:50.461
You fight all the time,
but when you're apart from each other,

00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:53.422
you miss them,
and look to each other for support.

00:43:56.926 --> 00:43:59.679
That's why I did the best I could
with the auditions.

00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:01.264
I hoped it'd work out.

00:44:02.932 --> 00:44:04.267
Oh, well.

00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:06.435
I guess I'm not talented.

00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:08.062
I failed again.

00:44:08.938 --> 00:44:10.731
I was really confident this time.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.651
Did they tell you why you didn't make it?

00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:17.405
Well, most of the judges
seemed to like it,

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:20.700
but one of them didn't like my singing.

00:44:20.783 --> 00:44:22.160
<i>Your name's Miyoung, right?</i>

00:44:22.994 --> 00:44:25.329
Do you have money? Or connections?

00:44:25.413 --> 00:44:28.457
If you do, bring me at least one.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.713
You can't simply get a job here.

00:44:41.262 --> 00:44:44.223
Miyoung, my shift is over.
I'm leaving work.

00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:47.685
- I better go back in.
- Okay, go on.

00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:49.187
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:54.609
Miyoung.

00:44:55.985 --> 00:44:58.029
What's the name of that place?

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.823
Nilbana. It's in Suseong-gu.

00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:02.617
Why do you ask?

00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:04.827
Because I don't want to go there.

00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:06.954
It'd be weird to visit a place
that turned you down.

00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:11.751
I see. Take care. I'll call you.

00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:12.835
Okay, bye.

00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:27.308
Oh, Nilbana? What about it?

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.101
I'm going there for a reason.

00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:30.978
<i>Why don't you go somewhere else?</i>

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.063
Why?

00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:33.940
It comes under the Taehoon Gang turf.

00:45:34.023 --> 00:45:37.443
<i>The owner there</i>
<i>is Taehoon's younger cousin or something.</i>

00:45:39.028 --> 00:45:41.322
Really? Do they get a lot of customers?

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.074
<i>Well, it has a good vibe.</i>

00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:45.201
<i>It's the biggest and busiest place</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:47.328
Not long ago,

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:50.748
a singer who performed there
went viral and became a star.

00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.209
She got recruited
by a big entertainment agency.

00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.002
Really?

00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:30.538
AUDITION FOR BANDS AND SOLO ARTISTS

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.377
So, you're telling me
you want her to reaudition?

00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:37.962
Yes.

00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:40.423
She said she couldn't show all her talent.

00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:41.507
Hmm.

00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:45.553
Did you say her name was Kang Miyoung?

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:49.348
Oh, I remember.
That lady who can't bend notes.

00:46:49.432 --> 00:46:51.058
Well, yes.

00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:54.061
Still, she's quite a skilled singer.

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.398
I'd like to give her another chance,

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.817
but it's not something
I just can do, you know?

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.738
I know. That's why I came down here myself
to ask you for a favor.

00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:06.532
A favor...

00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:16.125
If you fill my pockets a little,
I could figure out a way to do it.

00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:18.961
Fill your pockets?

00:47:19.545 --> 00:47:20.921
As in this?

00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:22.256
Correct.

00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:24.008
Come on, please.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.303
Do you really need to take a bribe
over such a low-paying job?

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:28.429
Please be considerate.

00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:30.473
Are you kidding me?

00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:33.726
Okay. I'll give you a discount.

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:35.770
Make it 10.

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.814
How about a million?

00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:41.609
A million won is hardly enough.

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:42.860
10 million.

00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:44.945
10 million, huh?

00:47:47.948 --> 00:47:49.033
Tsk!

00:47:49.909 --> 00:47:50.910
Okay.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.871
I'll cut it down by half.
Five million, okay?

00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:56.165
Sorry, how much? I didn't hear you.

00:47:56.248 --> 00:47:58.125
- Could you tell me again?
- Jeez.

00:47:58.918 --> 00:48:00.002
Five million.

00:48:01.003 --> 00:48:03.964
It was you, wasn't it?

00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:07.093
You turned Miyoung down
and gave the job to those who bribed you.

00:48:07.176 --> 00:48:08.928
Five million, huh?

00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.846
Auditions should always be fair.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.391
- Even 500 won is too much for you.
- Ow, my ear!

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.603
Sir.

00:48:23.192 --> 00:48:26.695
I didn't know
you were acquainted with Bokcheon.

00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:30.616
- Let me apologize.
- There's no need.

00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:33.452
I'm sorry I caused scene.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.746
You should've told me.

00:48:36.455 --> 00:48:37.665
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:40.918
Hire that woman who auditioned.
Tell her to begin work right away.

00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:42.211
Sure, I'll do that.

00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:44.672
Hey, come on. That's not what I want.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.590
It's an audition. Her skills matter.

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:50.094
- Was she good?
- Yes.

00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:53.180
She was the best of all the candidates.

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:54.849
It's true.

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:56.725
Then why didn't you hire her?

00:48:57.685 --> 00:48:58.727
Pardon me?

00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:00.980
It's all good now, right? I'm off.

00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:04.775
Sir, why don't you have a drink
while you're here?

00:49:04.859 --> 00:49:06.026
Can't. I need to drive.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.654
We can talk about
what I told you the other day.

00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.116
Why talk about something
we already discussed?

00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:14.910
Thugs don't change teams for money
like baseball players do.

00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:16.579
Bye.

00:49:16.662 --> 00:49:18.789
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

00:49:19.999 --> 00:49:21.000
Damn you.

00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:25.254
You're sound asleep, Mom.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.359
Hello?

00:49:47.443 --> 00:49:49.195
<i>Is this Ms. Kang Miyoung?</i>

00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:50.321
Yes, that's me.

00:49:50.404 --> 00:49:53.782
<i>This is Yoon Iljoong,</i>
<i>the manager of Nilbana.</i>

00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:57.244
There was a misunderstanding
in the evaluation.

00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.997
<i>It turns out you've passed the audition.</i>

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:03.292
- Pardon?
- You got the job.

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.169
When can you start?

00:50:06.212 --> 00:50:07.922
- Tell her to start today.
- Shh!

00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:10.966
Well, we have a slot available today.
Can you make it?

00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:13.177
Yes.

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.471
Of course I can make it.

00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:18.265
I see. Then please be here by 7:00 p.m.

00:50:19.141 --> 00:50:20.184
Thank you.

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:21.810
Thank you.

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:31.654
The plan was to eat,
not play ball, you nutjobs.

00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:33.155
Come on, just do it.

00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:35.074
Use your feet, not your mouth. Hurry up.

00:50:35.157 --> 00:50:36.367
Gosh, you damn idiots.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.702
Watch closely.
This is called an eagle shot.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:43.624
Pathetic.

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:47.086
If Nature had been more strict
with evolution, you wouldn't have made it.

00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:49.129
I would've survived thanks to you guys.

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:52.258
You'd go out to fish and get injured,
and I'd treat you guys.

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:53.884
- Don't kick too hard.
- Kick hard.

00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:55.761
- This is a super eagle shot.
- Go easy.

00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:57.888
- Take this!
- Hey!

00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:59.598
Oh! Goal!

00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:01.225
You idiot! I told you not to kick hard!

00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:04.603
- Forget it, I have one here.
- Don't kick hard.

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.776
- Easy.
- You're dead meat.

00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:16.115
This is a super ultra eagle shot!

00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:19.493
<i>I got a girlfriend.</i>

00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:23.998
Really? Who is it?

00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:26.000
It's someone you know.

00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:27.835
Who?

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:32.256
Miyoung.

00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:33.340
- Who?
- Who's Miyoung?

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.467
That girl from our childhood?

00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:39.972
How did you guys happen to meet again?
Is she doing well?

00:51:40.055 --> 00:51:42.600
Mmm. She moved into town with her mom.

00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:43.934
She's doing well as always.

00:51:44.476 --> 00:51:45.603
I see.

00:51:45.686 --> 00:51:47.313
Yeah. As always, she's well.

00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:48.772
And pretty and bright, too.

00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:50.232
- She's a singer now.
- What?

00:51:50.316 --> 00:51:52.860
- A singer?
- Yes. She'll be famous soon.

00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:56.030
Let's all go out sometime,
with Byeongsoo, too.

00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:57.406
Right.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.368
Oh, right. Don't tell Seokhee
about our past relationship.

00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:02.995
Keep it from her, okay?

00:52:03.078 --> 00:52:05.664
Yeah, it isn't a good thing
to bring up the past, anyway.

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:10.210
But if she finds out I kept this from her,
she'll beat me to death.

00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:11.837
You know what she's like.

00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:13.464
Hey.

00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:15.549
Eat this and cheer up.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.301
What about this?

00:52:18.302 --> 00:52:20.095
I hope things work out between you two.

00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:21.430
I hope so, too.

00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:24.558
You guys liked each other so much
back then.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.482
All right, our Byeongsoo.

00:52:31.565 --> 00:52:32.900
- Open up.
- What is it?

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.152
- Open up!
- What is it?

00:52:37.363 --> 00:52:39.114
- We found our sister, you punk.
- Where?

00:52:39.198 --> 00:52:41.158
I'll tell you if you pay for this meal.

00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:42.534
No. I'm broke.

00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:44.411
- Oh, come on.
- What's going on?

00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:46.747
Hey, do you still have a crush on her?

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.123
That's not it.

00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:50.876
She's my friend's older sister.
It's not weird to ask.

00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:53.045
No, that's not it.

00:52:53.128 --> 00:52:54.463
You're blushing.

00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:58.509
You can't hide what your body says.
It portrays how you feel.

00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:00.678
I'm only blushing
because I'm eating something hot.

00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:02.221
Who's calling?

00:53:02.304 --> 00:53:05.099
- Hey, your face is red.
- Exactly.

00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:06.392
Hey, is it your sister?

00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:07.601
Hi.

00:53:07.685 --> 00:53:09.770
<i>Guess where I am.</i>

00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:11.188
Well...

00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:14.108
I'm not sure. Where?

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:18.028
I'm at Nilbana.

00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:21.615
Oh, really?

00:53:22.783 --> 00:53:23.826
What are you doing there?

00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:27.204
You won't believe what happened.

00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:28.997
But don't be so surprised.

00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:31.458
I'm performing here starting today.

00:53:32.334 --> 00:53:35.170
Wow, that's great. Congratulations.

00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:38.215
Thanks.

00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:41.009
Everything's working out
thanks to your support.

00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:44.346
Will you come see me tonight?

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:45.472
It's my first show.

00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:47.933
Of course I will.
I don't want to miss that.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.601
Make sure to come.

00:53:50.436 --> 00:53:52.855
I need to go.
I'll text you the time and address.

00:53:53.689 --> 00:53:54.690
Okay, bye.

00:53:55.274 --> 00:53:56.275
Bye.

00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:04.408
Goodness.

00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:10.497

00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:13.333

00:54:27.264 --> 00:54:28.390

Hello, Mr. Hwang.

00:57:08.675 --> 00:57:09.676
Nice to meet you.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.386
Mr. Chairman, this is Mr. Hwang.

00:57:12.888 --> 00:57:15.515
You could've waited inside for us
instead of out here.

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:16.600
MYEONGSAN SEJONG HOTEL

00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:20.395
I hear people of OSEON E&amp;C
sleep only at five-star hotels.

00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:26.526
- That was a good one.
- I love that.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:27.694
<i>Right.</i>

00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:00.727
This is a small gift for you.

00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:02.854
Oh, goodness. You don't need to do this.

00:58:02.938 --> 00:58:04.898
Sir, don't make me upset.

00:58:06.692 --> 00:58:08.902
Please accept it. It's from me.

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:11.363
Gosh, this really isn't necessary.

00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:14.324
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Sure, thank you.

00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:17.452
Who are you?

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:19.663
Mr. Kim Changsoo.

00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:25.419
Who are you?

00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:32.884
We've arrived, Mr. Chairman.

00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:14.885
- What is it?
- <i>Boss, we got a problem.</i>

00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:17.637
The police raided our office,
said they were conducting a search.

00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:19.347
What?

00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:20.807
What are you talking about?

00:59:20.891 --> 00:59:21.892
I'm not sure.

00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:24.269
Damn it!

00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:25.687
