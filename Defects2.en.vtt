that he may have fallen off the bridge.

- Ah Hyun.

00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:56.343
heavily damaged
the belongings inside the vehicle,

Since it's scheduled for demolition,
no one's here.

00:15:11.491 --> 00:15:12.325
Are you sure?

00:15:12.826 --> 00:15:13.660
Yes.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.929
They're kids who shouldn't exist
in this world.

00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:18.798
So where would they go?

00:15:20.934 --> 00:15:22.702
A place that doesn't exist in this world.

00:15:27.374 --> 00:15:29.276
(Bathhouse)

00:15:38.418 --> 00:15:39.252
Listen carefully.

00:15:40.954 --> 00:15:42.222
Once you leave here,

00:15:43.356 --> 00:15:44.724
you have to forget your past memories.

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:46.293
Ah Hyun.

00:15:47.294 --> 00:15:48.261
What about Tae Sik?

00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:51.998
Did he really die?

00:15:55.669 --> 00:15:56.503
Guys.

00:15:57.204 --> 00:15:59.406
What do you think
Tae Sik wanted most from us?

00:16:04.511 --> 00:16:05.712
Unauthorized departure.

00:16:07.614 --> 00:16:10.617
We don't have to live in hiding anymore.

00:16:10.617 --> 00:16:12.786
We're going to a safe place
where no one knows us.

00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:14.254
Once we're there,

00:16:14.888 --> 00:16:17.424
we can go outside whenever we want,

00:16:19.259 --> 00:16:21.428
play in the water all we want,
and eat delicious...

00:16:25.098 --> 00:16:25.966
Are you okay?

00:16:26.233 --> 00:16:27.634
- What was that?
- Are you okay?

00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:30.103
Demolition prep complete.

00:16:35.609 --> 00:16:37.611
- We have to go.
- Get them out now! Hurry!

00:16:46.953 --> 00:16:47.787
Go!

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:53.693
This way, over here.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:04.871
Gyu Tae.

00:17:07.974 --> 00:17:08.975
Let's go in.

00:17:09.442 --> 00:17:10.343
Yes.

00:17:16.283 --> 00:17:17.150
Open it.

00:17:22.823 --> 00:17:23.657
Hurry!

00:17:31.531 --> 00:17:32.732
What do we do now?

00:17:39.673 --> 00:17:41.074
Let's go that way, follow me!

00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:50.450
Hey.

00:17:52.452 --> 00:17:53.320
Move.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.754
Move.

00:17:55.722 --> 00:17:56.556
Hurry!

00:17:57.757 --> 00:17:59.559
- Hurry, let's go!
- Let's go.

00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:07.634
Careful.

00:18:07.634 --> 00:18:09.369
Careful, let's go.

00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:10.804
- Find them!
- Yes.

00:18:12.472 --> 00:18:14.207
Damn, where did they go?

00:18:21.381 --> 00:18:22.782
We have to go now! Hurry!

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.554
Hurry.

00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:39.366
Come on.

00:18:40.834 --> 00:18:41.735
Come.

00:18:43.537 --> 00:18:44.404
Are you okay?

00:18:47.374 --> 00:18:48.909
- Si Woo, are you okay?
- Si Woo!

00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:50.610
I'll take care of Si Woo.

00:18:53.013 --> 00:18:53.947
What do we do?

00:18:58.952 --> 00:18:59.853
There they are!

00:19:04.658 --> 00:19:05.559
Up there!

00:19:11.865 --> 00:19:12.766
Lift it up.

00:19:17.504 --> 00:19:18.438
Find them quickly!

00:19:18.438 --> 00:19:20.307
Hey, get in. You, go down.

00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:33.220
- Are you okay?
- Is Si Woo okay?

00:19:33.687 --> 00:19:35.155
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:36.189
Just hold on a little longer, Si Woo.

00:19:41.328 --> 00:19:42.162
Go in.

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:47.861
(Wednesday, 25:00, Incheon Port,
Nobmeori Sashimi Restaurant)

00:21:06.913 --> 00:21:08.748
Nice to meet you, Madam.

00:21:24.664 --> 00:21:27.133
I heard you needed me for something.

00:21:32.772 --> 00:21:33.874
So you came.

00:21:35.942 --> 00:21:37.444
I wanted to meet you.

00:21:38.879 --> 00:21:39.946
The Lord told me...

00:21:42.616 --> 00:21:45.252
to meet you, Sister.

00:21:47.587 --> 00:21:48.788
I see.

00:21:50.023 --> 00:21:51.191
That man is...

00:21:53.193 --> 00:21:54.728
perfect...

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.365
without me.

00:22:01.034 --> 00:22:03.370
Because I can't have children.

00:22:07.507 --> 00:22:09.209
Don't say that.

00:22:09.442 --> 00:22:11.244
You came all this way to find me.

00:22:17.484 --> 00:22:20.220
I want to give him a child that suits him.

00:22:22.522 --> 00:22:23.824
A perfect child.

00:22:31.097 --> 00:22:32.732
Si Woo didn't come to school again today.

00:22:33.533 --> 00:22:35.001
My mom said...

00:22:35.001 --> 00:22:37.504
Choi Si Woo was admitted
to a mental hospital.

00:22:37.504 --> 00:22:38.538
Really?

00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:41.141
What? But I heard he went missing.

00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:43.109
His mom made that up.

00:22:43.109 --> 00:22:45.812
My mom saw her laughing at a café.

00:22:45.812 --> 00:22:47.013
No way.

00:22:47.013 --> 00:22:48.915
I mean, how can she act like that
when her kid's missing?

00:22:49.249 --> 00:22:52.219
Exactly, that's why it's not really
a missing case.

00:22:54.988 --> 00:22:56.723
(Choi Si Woo)

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.461
Honey.

00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:02.963
Mom.

00:23:06.666 --> 00:23:07.567
Come.

00:23:08.735 --> 00:23:09.636
Let's go.

00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:21.848
Honey.

00:23:23.116 --> 00:23:23.850
Yes?

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.085
What did I tell you?

00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:27.521
I told you
you must always pay attention...

00:23:27.521 --> 00:23:28.955
to appearances when you're outside, right?

00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:32.292
I'm sorry.

00:23:32.893 --> 00:23:34.227
Whose daughter are you, honey?

00:23:34.928 --> 00:23:35.929
Your daughter, Mom.

00:23:36.163 --> 00:23:37.264
Who do you take after?

00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:38.865
You, Mom.

00:23:39.466 --> 00:23:42.936
Then you should always stand out
wherever you go, right?

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.539
Yes, like you, Mom.

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:49.209
Honey.

00:23:50.844 --> 00:23:53.847
I'm in such a good mood today...

00:23:53.847 --> 00:23:55.148
like I could fly.

00:23:55.849 --> 00:23:58.418
I think the moment I dreamed of
is coming soon.

00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:02.122
Honey, do you want me
to tell you about my childhood?

00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:03.423
Yes.

00:24:04.691 --> 00:24:06.960
When I was in school,

00:24:08.094 --> 00:24:10.397
I thought I'd die
if I didn't get first place.

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:13.500
But look what happened.

00:24:14.334 --> 00:24:15.602
I didn't die, right?

00:24:15.902 --> 00:24:16.770
That's right.

00:24:17.404 --> 00:24:19.539
No one should die over a rank.

00:24:24.644 --> 00:24:25.579
I...

00:24:27.047 --> 00:24:28.648
never lost first place.

00:24:30.417 --> 00:24:31.651
That's why I didn't die.

00:24:36.723 --> 00:24:38.024
Just kidding.

00:24:50.904 --> 00:24:51.771
Uncle.

00:24:54.341 --> 00:24:55.642
Hey.

00:24:58.545 --> 00:24:59.379
Have you eaten?

00:25:00.313 --> 00:25:01.148
Have you?

00:25:05.318 --> 00:25:06.419
Stop eating now.

00:25:07.954 --> 00:25:09.890
If you don't tell,
no one would know, Uncle.

00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:16.429
Look at this.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.865
You need to know when to stop exercising.

00:25:25.438 --> 00:25:28.642
If you overdo things,
you'll eventually get hurt.

00:25:29.075 --> 00:25:30.644
You have to overdo things to win.

00:25:32.913 --> 00:25:33.980
But Uncle,

00:25:34.614 --> 00:25:35.649
Mom...

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.887
Nothing, Uncle.

00:25:42.022 --> 00:25:44.724
Actually, do you remember
what I told you before...

00:25:45.525 --> 00:25:47.194
about my best friend in class?

00:25:48.995 --> 00:25:49.963
He...

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.532
hasn't shown up to school in days.

00:25:55.235 --> 00:25:56.169
So what?

00:25:56.937 --> 00:25:57.904
I don't know.

00:25:58.972 --> 00:26:01.141
There are all sorts of rumors.

00:26:02.742 --> 00:26:04.511
Some say he went to a mental hospital,

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:07.647
others say he went missing.

00:26:11.585 --> 00:26:12.919
I hope he's okay.

00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:17.624
You should go now. It's time for dinner.

00:26:34.741 --> 00:26:35.642
Let's go.

00:26:55.896 --> 00:26:56.763
Why aren't you coming?

00:26:58.565 --> 00:26:59.666
Isn't this place amazing?

00:27:05.272 --> 00:27:06.173
Someday,

00:27:08.408 --> 00:27:09.743
I don't know when,

00:27:15.782 --> 00:27:16.883
let's come back here.

00:27:25.392 --> 00:27:26.726
Yes, let's come back.

00:27:27.527 --> 00:27:29.196
Let's make a promise. Promise.

00:27:30.363 --> 00:27:31.331
I said let's make a promise.

00:27:31.331 --> 00:27:33.633
Not a handshake. Pinky promise.

00:27:33.633 --> 00:27:34.501
Promise.

(Nobmeori Sashimi Restaurant)

00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:50.984
What now?

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:54.488
Ah Hyun, is no one there?

00:27:57.791 --> 00:27:59.059
Do we have to keep standing here?

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:00.460
Wait.

But this...

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.119
It's going to be a tough way there.

00:28:59.119 --> 00:29:00.187
You'll need money as well.

00:29:00.787 --> 00:29:02.823
That includes Tae Sik's share.

00:29:02.823 --> 00:29:04.191
So don't hesitate. Take it.

00:33:59.553 --> 00:34:01.688
The reason is unsatisfactory quality.

00:34:02.656 --> 00:34:04.891
Shit, do I really have to do this?

00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:08.295
I agree to disown
and dispose of Yoon Ji Seok,

00:34:08.295 --> 00:34:10.530
whom I adopted 17 years ago.

00:34:10.831 --> 00:34:11.832
You say it too.

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:13.500
I agree.

00:34:17.037 --> 00:34:18.572
I, Han Cheol Soo,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.676
agree to disown and dispose of Han Yu Na,

00:34:23.376 --> 00:34:27.314
whom I adopted 17 years ago.

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:30.951
The reason is...

00:34:37.257 --> 00:34:38.191
At the very least,

00:34:42.329 --> 00:34:44.531
I thought there'd be
at least one sad backstory...

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.634
like they couldn't afford to raise us,

00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:49.836
or they just couldn't form an attachment.

00:34:51.071 --> 00:34:52.138
But no.

00:34:52.873 --> 00:34:54.341
We were just products.

00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:56.643
They bought us with money,

00:34:57.477 --> 00:34:59.146
and if they didn't like us,
they'd return us...

00:35:01.414 --> 00:35:02.282
like products.

00:35:03.183 --> 00:35:04.184
Products?

00:35:05.785 --> 00:35:06.620
We were...

00:35:08.622 --> 00:35:09.856
products.

00:35:13.994 --> 00:35:15.195
I'll kill them.

00:35:17.597 --> 00:35:18.965
I'll kill them all.

00:35:20.433 --> 00:35:21.535
I need to know.

00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:24.504
Why the people
who were once our parents are...

00:35:25.672 --> 00:35:27.641
going so far just to kill us.

00:35:28.241 --> 00:35:30.010
Why we have to live like fugitives.

00:35:31.511 --> 00:35:33.747
People who buy and sell children
like merchandise,

00:35:34.481 --> 00:35:35.382
and…

00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:39.519
what Tae Sik wasn't able to find.

00:35:40.687 --> 00:35:41.588
The monster.

00:35:45.158 --> 00:35:46.326
I'm going to find it.

00:35:50.764 --> 00:35:52.199
This won't be easy.

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:54.701
(Principal of Daehan Elementary School,
Han Cheol Soo)

00:35:54.701 --> 00:35:55.569
But this…

00:35:56.903 --> 00:35:57.938
(VIP Membership)

00:35:57.938 --> 00:35:58.972
Isn't this a card?

00:36:01.341 --> 00:36:02.909
We should probably start with this.

00:36:06.246 --> 00:36:07.147
You're right.

00:36:07.347 --> 00:36:08.815
But how do we even find it?

00:36:16.723 --> 00:36:18.258
I think I've seen it before.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.799
(A school of dreams and love
where happiness lives)

00:36:26.733 --> 00:36:29.135
I love you.

00:36:34.908 --> 00:36:37.644
- Hello.
- Hello. I love you.

00:36:40.514 --> 00:36:41.748
Hello.

00:36:41.748 --> 00:36:44.217
- Hello. I love you.
- Thanks.

00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:47.154
Hello, I love you.

00:36:48.722 --> 00:36:51.791
After-school classes will begin next week.

00:36:51.791 --> 00:36:53.426
Okay, then.

00:36:54.394 --> 00:36:57.097
Post the job opening
for an assistant teacher immediately.

00:36:57.097 --> 00:36:57.864
Yes.

00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:18.084
(Daehan Elementary School)

00:37:18.084 --> 00:37:19.586
Yes, come in.

00:37:24.057 --> 00:37:27.861
Principal Han,
you must attend today's dinner.

00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:31.131
Was that today?

00:37:31.131 --> 00:37:31.865
Yes.

00:37:31.865 --> 00:37:35.035
If I go, the other teachers
might feel uncomfortable.

00:37:35.035 --> 00:37:36.770
No, not at all.

00:37:37.137 --> 00:37:40.006
Everyone's waiting for you.

00:37:42.042 --> 00:37:45.378
But I already have plans for tonight.

00:37:45.946 --> 00:37:49.716
Even if you just stop by for a bit,

00:37:49.716 --> 00:37:53.053
it will mean a lot to the teachers,
Principal Han.

00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:57.357
I'll try to make time.

00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:00.126
Okay, Principal Han.

00:38:11.705 --> 00:38:14.174
Breathe slowly.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.211
What's wrong?

00:38:19.312 --> 00:38:20.480
(Mom)

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.916
Yu Na, I'm sorry.

00:38:22.916 --> 00:38:24.084
Could you come out for a minute?

00:38:26.753 --> 00:38:27.654
Mom.

00:38:49.176 --> 00:38:50.844
Ju An, can you hear me?

00:38:51.411 --> 00:38:52.345
Yes, I hear you.

00:39:05.859 --> 00:39:06.793
He's in the car.

00:39:09.996 --> 00:39:10.964
We'll follow him.

00:39:13.233 --> 00:39:14.000
Let's go.

00:39:34.187 --> 00:39:35.188
Go ahead and smoke.

00:39:36.122 --> 00:39:37.123
No, it's fine.

00:39:37.757 --> 00:39:38.825
Why'd you put it out?

00:39:44.331 --> 00:39:45.899
I heard you're heading somewhere nice.

00:39:45.899 --> 00:39:46.766
Sorry?

00:39:47.033 --> 00:39:48.368
No.

00:39:49.669 --> 00:39:51.037
Vice Principal, would you like to...

00:39:51.037 --> 00:39:52.572
No, that would be bad.

00:39:54.274 --> 00:39:56.710
I didn't know you smoked too,
Principal Han.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:58.245
Sometimes.

00:39:59.346 --> 00:40:00.814
Are you heading to a second round?

00:40:00.814 --> 00:40:01.781
Second?

00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:03.016
No, not at all.

00:40:03.517 --> 00:40:05.152
Well, have a good time.

00:40:05.752 --> 00:40:06.786
Take care, sir.

00:40:07.988 --> 00:40:09.289
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:40:09.289 --> 00:40:10.190
I'll go now.

00:40:17.731 --> 00:40:18.965
You need a driver, don't you?

00:40:33.113 --> 00:40:34.047
Let's go.

00:40:55.202 --> 00:40:57.237
You look young, Miss.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.075
Don't worry, I've got a license.

00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.944
How old are you?

00:41:08.114 --> 00:41:09.282
Why are you asking?

00:41:11.718 --> 00:41:12.652
Sorry.

00:41:37.577 --> 00:41:38.645
We're here.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.022
(Lady born in 2008 on call)

00:41:50.056 --> 00:41:50.891
Excuse me.

00:41:52.492 --> 00:41:54.127
Can I see your license?

00:41:54.594 --> 00:41:55.462
Excuse me?

00:41:57.797 --> 00:41:58.765
How old are you?

00:41:59.499 --> 00:42:02.202
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.604
Why do you ask?

00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:06.339
You look young.

00:42:07.174 --> 00:42:09.509
You look barely 20.

00:42:10.243 --> 00:42:11.178
Maybe 21?

00:42:11.778 --> 00:42:14.548
You only just took off
your school uniform, right?

00:42:14.714 --> 00:42:16.683
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:42:26.726 --> 00:42:28.461
They haven't moved out yet.

00:42:38.872 --> 00:42:41.107
Do you want to come up and have coffee?

00:42:42.642 --> 00:42:45.412
Don't worry, I live alone.

00:42:50.016 --> 00:42:51.518
I don't really want coffee.

00:42:55.722 --> 00:42:58.692
To be honest, I need some money.

00:42:59.826 --> 00:43:01.661
So I do whatever makes money.

00:43:02.262 --> 00:43:03.163
Nice.

00:43:04.664 --> 00:43:07.067
You look even younger without your cap.

00:43:08.935 --> 00:43:12.072
I like kids who look young like you.

00:43:12.072 --> 00:43:13.406
Even better...

00:43:13.673 --> 00:43:15.175
if they're real kids.

00:43:17.277 --> 00:43:18.645
But the best part is...

00:43:19.012 --> 00:43:22.415
when those kids say they need money.

00:43:22.415 --> 00:43:23.483
That's the best.

00:43:25.585 --> 00:43:27.287
Money's great.

00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:30.490
But...

00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:34.027
I know someone
I think you'd like even more.

00:43:34.828 --> 00:43:37.130
She's even younger, and more baby-faced.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.335
But she's a minor.

00:43:43.103 --> 00:43:44.638
That's too far, isn't it?

00:43:44.638 --> 00:43:47.541
No. I love it.

00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:49.109
How old is she?

00:43:52.212 --> 00:43:53.246
Born in 2008.

00:43:54.981 --> 00:43:57.217
Should I call her here?

00:43:57.551 --> 00:44:00.153
Call her.

00:44:00.453 --> 00:44:01.288
Call her.

00:44:08.895 --> 00:44:09.830
Where's Ju An?

00:44:16.937 --> 00:44:17.804
Ju An.

00:44:19.372 --> 00:44:20.640
Are you sure about this?

00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:21.975
Yes.

00:44:27.747 --> 00:44:28.582
Where's Si Woo?

00:44:29.382 --> 00:44:30.350
He's asleep.

00:44:30.917 --> 00:44:31.651
Let's go.

00:44:39.626 --> 00:44:40.494
Ju An.

00:44:42.662 --> 00:44:43.530
Be careful.

00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:45.432
Don't worry.

00:44:46.399 --> 00:44:47.234
I'll go now.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.342
Come in.

00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:34.047
No issues found
at Mr. Han Cheol Soo's residence.

00:45:34.047 --> 00:45:36.183
No issues found
at Mr. Kwon Kang Man's residence.

00:45:36.616 --> 00:45:38.718
Proceeding
to Mr. Choi Hyun Gyu's residence.

00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:56.503
Why aren't you taking off the scarf?

00:45:58.138 --> 00:45:58.972
Are you cold?

00:46:04.044 --> 00:46:05.679
You're quite shy.

00:46:06.413 --> 00:46:08.215
Are you really a high schooler?

00:46:09.015 --> 00:46:09.950
Tenth grade?

00:46:10.717 --> 00:46:11.551
Eleventh?

00:46:12.953 --> 00:46:15.755
Why put on so much makeup
when you're still a student?

00:46:15.755 --> 00:46:17.791
Do you want to take a bath with me?

00:46:21.127 --> 00:46:22.262
Just kidding.

00:46:32.639 --> 00:46:33.773
Hold still.

00:46:46.753 --> 00:46:48.588
A bath?

00:46:48.588 --> 00:46:52.292
You're such a perverted son of a bitch.

00:46:52.692 --> 00:46:54.794
Who are you, you punk?

00:46:54.794 --> 00:46:55.795
What are you doing?

00:46:56.463 --> 00:46:57.898
You bastard!

00:46:59.332 --> 00:47:00.300
- On your knees.
- You…

00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:02.769
Yu Na.

00:47:03.103 --> 00:47:04.671
I said kneel, you bastard!

00:47:13.747 --> 00:47:15.515
I'll go stand guard.

00:47:16.149 --> 00:47:17.184
Finish it quick and let's get out.

00:47:25.525 --> 00:47:26.726
Where's the membership card?

00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:30.764
What are you talking about?

00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:34.334
Where's the membership card?

00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:37.938
I really don't know.

00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:39.439
I know nothing.

00:47:41.875 --> 00:47:43.009
Where is Im Gyeong Mi?

00:47:43.476 --> 00:47:44.945
Where is that bitch?

00:47:47.214 --> 00:47:49.483
Yu Na.

00:47:49.483 --> 00:47:50.517
Fuck.

00:47:51.852 --> 00:47:54.321
Fuck, stop calling me that!

00:47:54.688 --> 00:47:57.791
When you're angry,

00:48:04.764 --> 00:48:05.665
Yu Na.

00:48:06.366 --> 00:48:08.935
Didn't I tell you to control
your breathing when you're angry?

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.938
Breathe slowly.

00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:20.113
Good.

00:48:21.148 --> 00:48:22.949
Good job, Yu Na.

00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:28.321
You piece of garbage.

00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:31.391
Did you think I'd fall for it again?

00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:32.559
Where's Im Gyeong Mi?

00:48:34.161 --> 00:48:35.428
Where's Im Gyeong Mi?

00:48:35.729 --> 00:48:37.564
Where is she?

00:48:37.564 --> 00:48:39.232
She went to her parents' house.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.102
She left
when the house is a mess like this?

00:48:42.869 --> 00:48:45.605
I've never seen her leave the house
for this long.

00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:49.042
You'd better...

00:48:49.943 --> 00:48:51.244
speak clearly.

00:48:51.511 --> 00:48:53.346
Or the photos on your phone...

00:48:54.948 --> 00:48:56.550
will be sent to everyone.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:57.450
Are you crazy?

00:48:59.152 --> 00:49:02.455
Do you think
you'll all get away with this?

00:49:03.089 --> 00:49:04.791
I already haven't.

00:49:05.392 --> 00:49:06.793
And there's one more thing.

00:49:07.127 --> 00:49:08.195
Nice.

00:49:09.462 --> 00:49:11.698
You look even younger without your cap.

00:49:12.566 --> 00:49:15.335
I like kids who look young like you.

00:49:16.503 --> 00:49:18.071
Even better...

00:49:18.438 --> 00:49:19.906
if they're real kids.

00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:23.577
But the best part is...

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:26.813
when those kids say they need money.

00:49:28.081 --> 00:49:29.316
That's the best.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:30.951
Hey!

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.392
I know! I know where Im Gyeong Mi is!

00:49:39.759 --> 00:49:40.861
Mental hospital!

00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:42.796
I had her admitted to a mental hospital!

00:49:43.363 --> 00:49:45.165
- What?
- She lost her mind.

00:49:45.165 --> 00:49:46.733
She finally lost it.

00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:48.835
Speak clearly and slowly!

00:49:50.036 --> 00:49:53.740
The moment she heard you were missing,

00:49:54.875 --> 00:49:58.144
she searched all over the country for you.

00:49:58.712 --> 00:50:01.114
In the end, she went mad.

00:50:01.681 --> 00:50:02.516
I…

00:50:04.317 --> 00:50:05.218
What?

00:50:06.219 --> 00:50:07.888
The one who refunded you...

00:50:08.522 --> 00:50:10.624
wasn't your mom.

00:50:10.624 --> 00:50:11.625
It was me.

00:50:23.603 --> 00:50:25.805
Yu Na, I'm sorry.

00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:27.340
Could you come out for a minute?

00:50:30.911 --> 00:50:31.878
Mom.

00:50:47.427 --> 00:50:48.361
Mom.

00:51:15.222 --> 00:51:17.958
(Yu Na, I'm sorry.
Could you come out for a minute?)

00:51:17.958 --> 00:51:19.359
(Deleted)

00:51:29.836 --> 00:51:31.004
My mind's all over the place.

00:51:31.271 --> 00:51:32.806
You scatterbrain.

00:51:33.373 --> 00:51:34.274
Where's Yu Na?

00:51:35.108 --> 00:51:36.142
She went out earlier.

00:51:36.443 --> 00:51:37.511
I'll be back, honey.

00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:39.946
Tell Yu Na I'll be checking her essay
when she gets home.

00:51:40.447 --> 00:51:41.314
Got it.

00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:42.949
Let's go, sir.

00:51:56.296 --> 00:51:57.831
I had no idea,

00:52:00.433 --> 00:52:01.768
and I cursed my mother.

00:52:03.603 --> 00:52:04.437
Tell me.

00:52:05.405 --> 00:52:06.573
Tell me where Mom is.

00:52:07.307 --> 00:52:08.308
Tell me!

00:52:08.775 --> 00:52:09.843
So Mi, calm down.

00:52:09.843 --> 00:52:12.212
Tell me!

00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:13.380
You can't kill him!

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.416
Tell me where the hospital is.

00:52:16.416 --> 00:52:18.118
- I'll kill him.
- No!

00:52:23.123 --> 00:52:26.827
(The Defects,
Epilogue)

00:52:31.965 --> 00:52:32.899
Honey.

00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:33.834
Yes?

00:52:33.834 --> 00:52:35.769
Don't worry too much about Si Woo.

00:52:35.769 --> 00:52:37.003
He'll be fine.

00:52:54.855 --> 00:52:56.490
(Kim Ah Hyun)

00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:03.797
(Kim Ah Hyun)

00:53:28.522 --> 00:53:30.490
(Winner of the 2022 Broadcast &amp; Video
Content Proposal Competition)

00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:34.060
(Special thanks to actors Yoo Seung Mok
and Kim Soo Ro for their appearances.)

00:53:34.594 --> 00:53:37.130
(The Defects)

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.298
How many kids are there?

00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:39.533
Five in total.

00:53:39.533 --> 00:53:40.901
You must've seen her face, then.

00:53:40.901 --> 00:53:42.435
I wonder if she looks like me.

00:53:42.903 --> 00:53:43.937
I found it.

00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:46.306
Confirm Han Cheol Soo's residence.

00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:47.407
Get out of there now.

00:53:47.774 --> 00:53:49.743
What were your parents like, Ah Hyun?

00:53:49.743 --> 00:53:52.679
A woman who wanted to shine
more than anyone.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.148
Please leave behind
some kind of collateral.

00:53:55.148 --> 00:53:57.517
There's something
I'd like to ask you, Ah Hyun.

00:53:57.517 --> 00:53:58.585
You'll help, right?

00:53:58.585 --> 00:53:59.986
Let's go find So Mi's mom.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.389
But we don't even know
how to use that card.

00:54:02.389 --> 00:54:03.990
Those bastards will be
all over that place.

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.991
Why go there?

00:54:05.292 --> 00:54:06.960
So Mi's mom will know.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.729
Why do you all keep struggling to live?

00:54:09.729 --> 00:54:10.897
If you're caught, you die...

00:54:10.897 --> 00:54:11.731
Mom!

00:54:12.432 --> 00:54:13.300
like this.

00:54:15.148 --> 00:54:17.148
