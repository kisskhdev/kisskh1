00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.799
Are you hurt?

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.600
Should I call you K

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.280
or Song Qian?

00:00:55.232 --> 00:00:56.384
What are you talking about?

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.759
I pressed it
when I was in danger just now.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.519
The person who knew I was in danger
and would come to save me

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.439
would only be K.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.799
Because you said,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.599
"If you press it..."

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.760

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:16.719
"I'll go to save you."

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.400
I'll go to save you.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:36.879
Why?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.159
Why do you pretend not to know me?

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:49.400
I have my reasons.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.400
Is it because of the Wei family?

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.599

Gu Nian, listen to me.

You must not
investigate this matter any further.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.439
You know the real culprit
behind all these murders.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.319
Yet, you choose to remain silent.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.960

to protect them, right?

Hello, we're checking in.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.600
Two king rooms, please.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.839
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence!

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.199
Are you also here
for the medical seminar?

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.199
Sorry, miss,

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.199
but we only have
one king room available now.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.000
Qian,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.079
luckily we booked a suite.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:59.560
Otherwise, we'd be competing
with Dr. Gu.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.120
Senior,

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.279
do you mind sharing a room with me?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.680
Not at all.

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:11.680
You're not a couple.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.000
It's improper to share a room.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.079
Qian,

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.600
how do you know they're not a couple?

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.439
Sharing a room is quite normal.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.959
That's right, Mr. Song.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.680
Aren't you a bit meddlesome?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.560
One king room, please.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.040

Okay.

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:35.879
Hello, Weiwei?

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.279
Did you open Zhou Shen's laptop?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.440
I did.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.480
But his office laptop is really clean.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.000

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.840

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.080
Nian?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.704
Why are you here?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.919
I wanted to invite you for lunch.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.440
Sure.

00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:18.080
What do you want to eat then?

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:19.559
Anything works.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:20.320
Let's go.

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:27.080
Wait a minute.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.759
He has a second laptop.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.720
Nian, be careful.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.039

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.320
Nothing.

Will you wash up?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.480
The seminar is about to start.

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:35.159
I need to get ready.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.200
You go on ahead.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.720

Zhou Shen is waiting for me.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360
I'll go back to my room.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.559
Gu Nian,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.919
Zhou Shen isn't the one.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:42.000
Then who is the one for me?

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.320
You?

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.360
Do you think I would be
with a drug dealer?

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.759
Mr. Song,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.240
please get your facts straight.

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:54.200
You have your fiancée.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.759
And I have my fiancé.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.000
Fiancé?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.720
What fiancé?

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:05.320
I've already accepted his proposal.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.519
Do you know what you're doing?

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.519
Of course, I do.

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:13.600
You and Wei Qing
are getting married next week.

00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:15.919
Zhou Shen and I
are also getting married soon.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.840
There's nothing between us anymore.

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:22.960
What do you mean by nothing?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.039
You said you loved me.

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:27.039
That was in the past.

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:32.240
Now, whether you're K

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.919
or Song Qian,

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.799
I won't love you anymore.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:16:59.240
Nian.
