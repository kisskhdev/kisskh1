[Episode 6]
[The Red Thread That Suddenly Appears]

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840
You almost couldn't breathe just now.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.900
Could you think about yourself more?

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.640
You're the one living in this body now.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.310
Are you worrying about me?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.810
I'm afraid you might accidentally die
in the bathroom.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.560
Then you'd better watch me closely.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.729
I was frightened today.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.900
Can I sleep beside you?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.200
You have such a bad sleeping posture.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.770
I've slept alone for so many years.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
I've got used to sleeping
in such a free-spirited way.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.730
I've slept on my own for so many years,
and my posture is good.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.020
I've slept on my own
for much longer than you have.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.579
I've decided.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.770
Before Zefang's soul comes back,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.420
I'll take good care of
his health and studies

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.990
and get his friendship and love back.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.560
Zefang. Zefang. It's always about Zefang.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.690
Don't you ever think about
what Xia Cha wants?

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.440
If Zefang still likes you

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.640
after he comes back,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.110
you have to give him a chance.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.140
Anyway,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.410
you're not against Zefang
getting close to you.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.490
I'm not

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.960
because that person is you.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.010
Why is it getting cold again?

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.990
Everyone has fear.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.740
I'm afraid of swimming.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Zefang is afraid of confined space.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.450
Ye Haiyuan,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.190
is there anything you're afraid of?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.650
Yu Chan also has a mole
at the corner of her eye.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.560
Is this a coincidence or fate?

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.900
Are you going to work?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.890
You won't be back late, will you?

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.620
It's not good for your health.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.110
You should worry about yourself, not me.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.290
Have you memorized all the key points?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.040
Hello, Qiansui.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.380
Do you know the name of the place

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.580
where Haiyuan works?

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.450
Who is it?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.830
Cha.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.860
It's Xia Zefang.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.460
You seem to be good
with Xia Zefang recently.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.159
Him?

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.870
He's funny.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.760
Funnier than me?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.180
Can I have your autograph?

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.580
I like you very much.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.110
I watch your every game.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.140
Thank you.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.340
Jiang Bailing, do you have a girlfriend?

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.650
Candid photos of others infringe
on their portrait rights, don't they?

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.380
Did you ask for his permission?

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.850
And you, Jiang Bailing.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.360
Don't sign your autographs randomly.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.460
This can lead to the swimming team
losing its reputation.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.160
I'm sorry.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.420
None of your business.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.130
I...

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.860
In this world,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.500
apart from my parents,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.310
he's the only one who can rein me in.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.330
There's no one else.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.130
I can't sign autographs for you.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.270
What's his relationship
with Jiang Bailing?

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.860
I don't know. I don't like him.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.320
Don't show up if you don't.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.470
It should be a little sour.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.950
I'll apply some honey.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.530
It should be perfect now.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.200
This isn't some improper venue, is it?

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.960
This way. This way.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.300
You're a student.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.560
Why do you have to make yourself so tired?

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.190
If you won't stop, I'll call the police!

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.090
Let's go!

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.910
Who were those two just now?

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.380
Why were you there?

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.480
Do you have a grudge with them?

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.910
Call the police
if you see such a thing happen.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.200
Why did you rush out?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.770
So you really work at a club?

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.830
Fill in occasionally.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.480
You're lying.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.170
Do you want me to talk to your mom?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.910
This kind of place is complicated.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.910
There are other jobs for you to pick.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.120
Can you make more money there,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.120
or do you need money?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.540
Did Huimei not
give you enough living expenses,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.550
or do you owe someone money?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.600
Say something.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.430
How can I help you
if you don't say anything?

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.470
I've never heard
Huimei talk about your dad.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.470
Where is he?

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.390
People think my mom is a mistress.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.230
I don't want her
to live on other men's money.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.410
I can take care of both my mom

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.490
and my little sister.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.590
Let me hug you. Let me hug you.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.850
I feel so sorry for you. Really.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.000
I didn't mean to yell at you.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.720
You have to tell me.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.800
Otherwise, how can I understand you?

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.290
You treat me like a child to comfort me.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.660
You are the same age as Zefang.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.270
In my eyes,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.940
you are both kids.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:31.650
You...

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.240
You're hugging me too tightly.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.830
I can't breathe.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.130
Wait for me!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.590
Young Master!

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.380
Young Master, don't go!

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.240
Young Master! Young Master, don't go!

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.220
Young Master, don't go!

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.280
Help!

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.180
Help!

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.220
It's okay. It's okay. I'm here.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.930
What were you so scared of in your dream?

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.100
Is it your dream or Xia Zefang's dream?

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.760
The three of you

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.890
have a mole at the same spot
at the corner of your eyes.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.070
Why?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.520
It's okay. It's okay.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.780
It's okay. It's okay.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.460
Is it just a dream,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.370
or is there really a red thread?

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.570
Hello?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.840
Hello, Qiansui.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.310
I'm lining up
to buy your favorite fried chicken.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.800
It'll take forever
to get through the line.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.930
It's a waste of time.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.360
You can just come here.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.170
It won't be a waste if it's for you.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.300
I'll be there later.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.470
Okay, bye.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.030
Jiang Bailing is so nice to you.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.870
Yes, he has always been like this.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.640
Always?

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.580
I was bullied by my classmates
in junior high school.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.510
He protected me.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.940
After I went to high school,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.520
he was the one
who brought me to know others.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.000
The relationship between you
is really special.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.080
Maybe I'm too used to it.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.200
Why do you keep looking at your hand?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.470
If...

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.960
I mean, it's just a hypothetical.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.880
If two people are connected
by a red thread,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.290
what does that mean?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.510
A red thread of marriage unites lovers
across a thousand miles.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.910
The connected red thread

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.900
means he's your lifelong love.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.640
Really?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.590
Do you believe in past and present life

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.020
or soul reincarnation?

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.530
A prominent psychologist
in the United States

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.130
once witnessed a case
of past and present life

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.230
through hypnotherapy.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.230
Things like dreams, marks,

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.140
fear for no reason,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.210
innate skills,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.420
and

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.560
the trust in strangers.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.610
Things that can't be explained in life

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.160
demonstrate the possible existence
of reincarnation.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.980
Why are you drawing all of a sudden?

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.130
Drawing?

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.360
I'm writing a dorm announcement.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.910
Drawing?

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.510
Let me try.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.820
You?

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.180
Can you do it?

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.770
I've practiced calligraphy, you know.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.020
[Announcement]

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.210
[Next Friday, we'll assess dorms
for cleanliness. Please keep...]

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.230
If you enter a competition,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.900
you'll definitely win a prize.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.250
Your calligraphy is amazing.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.580
Is there a calligraphy contest recently?

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.980
There is, and it's a key bonus project.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.040
Then I need to practice more.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:44.850
Look.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.010
The announcement looks different today.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.240
Yes, the handwriting before
is like chicken scratch—

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.520
completely unreadable.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.650
But today's handwriting is very nice.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.560
You just don't appreciate it.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.930
It's my version of cursive.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.190
Do you understand?

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.280
Kids' drawings.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.850
Doodles.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.340
Xia Zefang wrote it today.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.089
Xia Zefang?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.730
He's different.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.730
He can even fix a chair.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.030
Yeah, really.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.920
Don't you think it's so amazing
that he can even fix a chair?

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.520
The chair's leg was broken.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.609
It's easy to fix it.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.190
He can write calligraphy

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:25.619
and fix chairs.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.210
Just like my grandpa.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.130
Grandpa.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.440
That's ridiculous.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.770
That's ridiculous.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.980
How is that possible?

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.150
Look.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.130
Isn't it cute?

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.060
What is this?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.840
I especially made it for you.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.220
Don't waste your time
on unimportant things.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.230
Have you memorized the key points?

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.330
Speaking of which,
Zefang is young and has a sharp mind.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.830
I read through the notes once

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.430
and have memorized them all.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.100
But my English is weak.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.470
It's too hard
to understand those combined letters.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.810
But the dorm supervisor signed me up
for the calligraphy contest,

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.670
saying it can offset some points.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.950
You just came back,
and you're going out again.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.120
It's time for tutoring.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.380
Aren't you tired of working so many jobs?

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.750
While students are doing their homework,

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.910
I can study.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.080
It's nice to be so smart.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.810
Here.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:20.640
Yours.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.210
No.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.600
These are your pants.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.790
You can't dislike them.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.140
You ripped them when you fought
with the hooligans last time.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.140
I even sewed a panda pattern on them.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.770
The pattern is too cute for me.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.710
I don't think so.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.360
It just looks like you.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.280
And this.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.250
It's a set.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.810
Come on,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.050
all I thought about was you

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.330
while I was sewing this pair of pants.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.060
It took a long time.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.700
My hands even hurt.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.170
And you're the only one

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.960
who has this wood carving.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.930
When someone wanted it,

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.260
I refused immediately.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.140
And look.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.030
Here's an English word I learnt recently,

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.830
soulmate.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.810
It suits us, doesn't it?

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.510
You think I'm cute?

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.460
Not only cute

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.070
but also handsome.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.800
I didn't expect you to be like this,
Ye Haiyuan.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.520
Are you in a relationship?

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.630
Who gave this to you?

00:19:59.020 --> 00:19:59.990
So cute.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.500
Welcome.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.230
Hello.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.700
I'm Xia Cha.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.790
I'm Haiyuan's classmate.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.820
Cha?

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.650
Why are you here?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.100
This kid

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.280
has been taken care of by you.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.820
This is this year's champion tea leaves.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.440
It's a little something for you.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.380
Tea leaves.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.080
Thank you.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.590
These are Haru and Hana.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.270
Last time, I saw

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.430
you and Haiyuan buy clothes on the street.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.430
It was you, right?

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.140
I was looking at the embroidery
on the pants.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.540
It's very unique.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.650
You gave it to him as a present?

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.140
This one?

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.010
Not bad, right?

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.330
But I didn't buy it.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880
I made it myself.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.150
You're polite and good at embroidery.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.880
And you also like drinking tea.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.920
I want to join you with your permission,

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.500
so I came to H&H following Haiyuan.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.730
Are you here to work

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.930
or supervise him?

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.580
What stage are you two in?

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.560
Haiyuan is a student.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.040
It's so hard

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.570
for him to work so many jobs.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.780
So I want to help him

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.940
and keep an eye on him,

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.430
so that he won't go astray.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.830
He's a kid, after all.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.440
I'm older than him.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.520
Of course, I should take care of him.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.160
But isn't Haiyuan the same age as you?

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.750
You should study hard.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.600
It's okay. Come whenever you're free.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.900
You're welcome here.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.150
It's so nice to experience life together.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:49.640
Alright.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.430
We're closed.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.700
Hey,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.490
you work here?

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.950
No wonder you have money
to keep a man in Room 103.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.350
Don't make trouble here.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.820
Let's talk outside.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.810
Why are you here?

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.160
It's none of your business where he is.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.380
So you were the person
who troubled Haiyuan

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.180
the other day!

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:31.850
Why are you so sure

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.180
I did all the bad things?

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.410
Couldn't it be
that Ye Haiyuan did terrible things

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.670
and asked for trouble?

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.220
If it's not you,

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.570
you can just say it.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.350
Given what you said,

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.790
it feels like it's you.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.480
Xia Zefang, you're framing me up.

What is done by night appears by day.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.940
Can't you do things more openly,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.140
acting like a man?

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.760
Cha, are you okay?

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.470
What are you doing?

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.730
Don't do this!

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.350
I'm going to call the police!

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.550
What are you doing?

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.320
Stop it! Let go!

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.850
What are you doing?

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.130
Cha!

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.460
Cha, what's wrong?

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.340
Cha!

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.930
