00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.319
Hey, man. How you gonna fit all this?
You should've got a truck.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.197
That won't be an issue.
Just get the gate open.

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:36.495
I don't know. Are you sure,
though? I think we got ten here.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.764
Here they are, three boxes.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:58.058
Right. Open it. Let me see.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.185
What's the point? Just take it.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.604
Hey now, I've got to see them first.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:07.317
What? You feeling guilty? Huh?

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.654
Guilty? Me? Come on, bro.
Don't you trust me?

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.492
So,

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.828
how did you get these from Sinan?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.913
They were gonna ship them off to Japan,

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:22.332
but I shelled out extra cash
to snag them first.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.794
Hey, I'm telling you.
They're the real deal. Come on.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:27.379
I haven't even said anything yet.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.672
Seriously?

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.641
Oh, geez.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.604
I figured as much. These are all fake.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.274
That obvious, huh?

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.818
Obvious? This is all trash.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.947
Look at it. Is this Chinese pottery? Huh?

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.824
Well, they're not Chinese.
They're from Sinan.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.160
You ignorant jackass.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.537
Wasn't the ship Chinese, huh?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.333
So why would the Chinese be
carrying around a bunch of Korean pottery?

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.335
You kidding me? Ah, I had no idea.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:09.421
You gotta learn your shit first,
before you scam someone.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.048
Who's gonna wanna do business with you?

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.593
What am I supposed to do
with all these then?

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:15.802
How much was this?

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.429
500,000 won.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:20.641
Hey, you're the one who needed it quick.
So I paid it all in cash.

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:22.100
Ah. I get it.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.187
I guess
I'll have to sell them in bulk.

00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:29.650
-And that's why you're the best.
-Stop.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.568

Whoa, this is just, this is fantastic.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.457
These were going
to Japan originally.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.168
They really weren't easy to come by.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.170
- Really?
- Oh, these three right here?

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.381
-They're all like that.
-Yeah, I can see that.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.007
Man, how much is this gonna run me?

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:58.387
-These here? Priced at a million each.
-You saying it's a million for just one?

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:02.224
-What, is this made out of gold?
-This here is pottery from Sinan.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.226
They usually go for two million a piece.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.771
Hey, now. You expect me to believe
these cost that much, huh?

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.398
Why not? Are they too pricey?

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.024
Damn right, it's too pricey.

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.068
A million isn't something
I can just put down on this. Come on.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.321
Professor. You said you were
gonna bring over some big shot.

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:17.906
He is a big shot.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.702
This guy is the stepson
of a Japanese yakuza patriarch.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:24.204
Really? What's any of that matter, huh?

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.498
He doesn't know
the first thing about this pottery.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.667
Hey, he didn't say
he wasn't buying!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.168
Just haggling a little.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.879
What? How much, huh?

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:37.509
Let me see. How about this?

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.887
Everything from here to here
for five million.

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:42.764
Are you out of your mind?

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.808
You think you can rip me off
and I'll take it?

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.853
Come on. Cut him a good deal
while he's still interested.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.813
Don't you understand? It's a win-win.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.732
-Sounds good, right? Yeah.
-Yeah, okay, sounds good.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.944
Forget about it. You can't expect me
to slash the price.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.237
Listen, Granny.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.740
They're cracking down on the pottery
trade. Things are gonna be really hard up.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.951
Buyers like him are gonna be rare.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:06.163
No budging, no, sir.
Can't go below ten million.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.039
-Come on!
-One minute!

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.625
Let me sweeten the pot.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.544
Look.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:16.173
This here is a pistol
that belonged to our patriarch,

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.925
along with a real Yakuza Katana.
Truly one of a kind.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:23.388
All of these for the ceramics over there,
plus this one.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.681
Let's trade.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.224
Hey.

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.268
What am I supposed to do with these?

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.896
Besides, this can't be worth
what you're saying it is.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.481
What? Hey.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.276
You're looking at a real Edo relic here.
The blade's price alone is an easy mill.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.779
And here, you see this?

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:40.655
This part's gold,

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:42.783
and this part too,

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.452
and this part. All these parts are--

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.078
Look. This alone's worth five.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.917
Granny. You should trade.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.336
No, you don't know their worth.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.880
I'm losing money if I take this.
Just forget about it.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.340
Come on now!

00:04:58.882 --> 00:04:59.883
Stop being stubborn!

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.802
Oh, would you stop?

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.303
This is highway robbery. And I…

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.722
-I'm not doing it!
-Deal's sealed.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:09.142
All right, it's fine. Just head out.
What are you doing? Take them, okay? Go.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.560
What are you doing? I said no.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.103
- No. Just let go.
- Granny.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.939
-Deal's sealed! Okay?
-No!

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.273
Hey, let it go!

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.817
It's mine! What are you doing?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.652
-Why are you so strong, huh?
-Let go!

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.695
Hey, enough! Enough of this.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.906
We're done talking!
I'll take it all, okay?

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.366
Let go. Now!

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.494
You're just dragging it, dragging it out.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.329

Well, the thing is,
we gotta settle the payment issue first.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.666
We already settled this, I thought.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.337
I mean, do you really think
I'm gonna be able to cover the diver?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.130
Yeah, I do.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.132
It's included in the two million.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:47.717
Okay, look.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.471
I have this friend who's a cop.
And he needs to get cut in on this.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.640
After that, I'm taking
a pretty big loss here.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.812
Come on. What's the big deal here, huh?

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.523
Just talk to the guy in charge
and ask him for more money.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:03.358
I said I'm the boss.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.442
Is that so?

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:08.405
Then you should give me another million.
That way I can get it done.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.824
We gotta help each other out here.
Don't we, Gwanseok?

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.283
"Gwanseok"?

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.285
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:15.495
We're not equals here.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.914
Think a million is pocket change?

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.958
Bunch of bullshit. Go fuck yourself.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.043
- Hey, hey, wait, wait.
- Get off.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.128
Hey, hey.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:25.880
Okay?

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.800
Look, you got it all wrong.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.846
Do we have a diver? No.
How about a boat? No.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.973
There's just a lot of things
I gotta cover here.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.057
We have a boat.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.893
Well, a lot of locals live
right in that area, you know?

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.353
We can't take a boat like mine.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.313
The hell you talking about now?

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.274
If an offshore boat's
hanging by the shore,

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.609
don't you think
the Coast Guard will notice?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.988
Which is why we've got to do it
like the locals.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.365
We'll take a rowboat out there,
one with a motor.

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:53.783
That's the only way we can do this.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.953
Then I guess we don't need you.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.038
Not true.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.206
You see,

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.376
I can get a boat from
my wife's nephew in Jeungdo.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.504
-Okay.
-That's why I just need a little more.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.216
Like I said, I'm already paying you.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.093
So why don't you use
the money you're getting?

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.389
I can take my boat out whenever I need it.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.974
That one, though? That's his boat.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.018
He won't hand it out willy-nilly.
I gotta work him.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.979
What the hell is this shit?

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.064
Hey, look.

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.109
I won't ask for a lot, okay?
Just throw in another 50,000 won.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.364
We're really doing this.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.453
Geez.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.249 line:20%
HEAD OFFICE
OF HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.795
-What?
-Why do you sound so shocked?

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:50.507
Look, we can put the real ones in front,
the rest we can fill with replicas.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.425
That's a huge problem.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.470
Just imagine how this could damage
your museum if someone finds out.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:56.554
Listen.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.724
Who do you think
is actually going to visit this museum?

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:03.061
Have you been to Deoksugung Palace?
There's no one but children there.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:07.440
If even our best museums are like that,
who would even bother looking at ours?

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:13.446
The chairman, he already agreed
to buy everything that we could find.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:17.200
So you dig up a thousand pieces,
and we have to buy them all?

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.870
There's always a budget for everything,
and you stick to it.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.706
You can't expect us to take it all.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.377
Besides, what kind of museum
only displays Sinan pottery?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.630
Goryeo, Joseon,
all of it should be represented.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:36.177
And even then, it's not ours, isn't it?
It's Chinese pottery.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.721
I mean, what's the point
of displaying Chinese artifacts?

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.640
It should be about our own history.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.892
What are the students
supposed to learn from this?

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:47.397
I've discussed this with the chairman
at length already,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.149
so you should stop trying to negotiate.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.986
We'll give you five million won. Make sure
to include pieces from different periods.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.279
Five million?

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.908
The view will be incredible
once it's all finished.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.827
YEOUIDO APARTMENT COMPLEX
SIBEOM APARTMENT

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.911
- Yes, indeed.
- So,

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.080
where's the parking lot entrance again?

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.667
Ah. If you look over there,
it will be where that truck's headed.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.751
Ah.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.005
Before you start construction there,

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.339
double-check everything.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.049
Yes, chairman. Of course.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.343
Then I'll let you get back to it.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.262
All right. Have a good day, chairman.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.310
Mr. Song, hello.

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:27.312
Hello, chairman.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:32.692
Uh, didn't my wife
already settle everything with you?

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:34.944
I'm afraid nothing's been settled,
Chairman Cheon.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.738
In fact, it's all going down the drain.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:40.575
You made changes to our deal,
and now none of it makes sense.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.535
What do you mean exactly?

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.329
Well, you said you'd buy
whatever we grabbed,

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.747
so dig up as much as we could find.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.958
Of course, I'll buy them all.
They can't be that expensive.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:52.170
Ah, we're talking about treasures here.
They're worth quite a lot.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:58.134
Some treasures. We're talking about old
ceramics. You really call these treasures?

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.803
What, are they inlaid with gold?

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:01.888
Uh…

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.934
Gold has nothing on these.
These are truly invaluable.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.518
Look.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.604
I'm giving you five million. That's it.

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.274
You better figure out
how many that gets me.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:18.613
And I'm planning to fill it all,
an entire museum floor with just pottery.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:21.699
Wait. But…

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:30.959
Hey.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.127
What seems to be the problem today?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.755
Listen, Seongcheol.

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:39.050
Chairman Cheon ruined the whole thing.
That ignorant idiot…

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.512
Do you know how much
I've already spent on this?

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.807
That's terrible news. Geez.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.520
Can you think of any way to fix this?

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.689
Hey.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.692
You know some politicians, don't you?

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.443
Yeah.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:02.240
Every two years we have a presidential
and a general election.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.326
A lot of them will be out there
greasing palms.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.497
And the thing is, cash leaves
a bit of a trail behind to follow.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.666
But pottery?

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.251
It leaves a good impression.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:16.921
And better yet, you can
receive the present without losing face.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.047
So it's a win-win.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:20.883
Hey.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.386
That's pretty good.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:26.597
But there's a catch.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.807
Most of those people,

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.685
they come from old money
and have sharp eyes for these things.

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:33.563
You're saying I can't con them with fakes.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:35.565
Exactly.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:39.152
So that's why you should sell the
real ones over the air, and the fakes,

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.738
well, you can
give those to Chairman Cheon.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:42.822
Wow.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.784
You're an actual genius,
you know that?

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.747
Here. Cheers to that, huh?

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.665
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.542
In her old job,
she learned to make coffee,

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.502
so she opened this place here.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.796
But the local folk
don't know how to appreciate it.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.798
Most of the customers are out-of-towners.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:05.678
-Hey, so what's with the hair?
-Ms. Jang chopped it all off.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.181
I kept tryin' to run to Seoul
and she wasn't havin' it.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.017
So now, I ain't goin' nowhere.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.105
So anyway, how's that job goin'?

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.816
I don't know yet.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:22.445
Pottery lost at sea.
I bet it's worth a lot, isn't it?

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.989
Well, we won't know until we find it.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.824
Nah, you wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:30.036
When do you think you'll go to Seoul?

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.205
I'm not sure. Maybe a month.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.458
Things aren't exactly goin' great here.

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:39.545
You should drop by more often then.
That way, you can tell me all about Seoul.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.048
Tryin' to get my hair chopped?

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:45.134
You're a real riot.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.387

Would you like another?

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:14.580
Thank you,
but I've had quite enough.

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:17.291
Do they serve coffee
like this there? In Busan?

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:21.587
Nah, they don't give you this
much in Busan. Barely a sip, you know?

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:25.007
Some Busan guys
are here in the area.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.970
-How many are they?
-I don't know exactly how many there are.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.598
But there's this one guy
called Professor Kim.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.183
So just be careful.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.018
'Cause we might butt heads.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:39.564
Think we should start
servin' less too?

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.734
I was tryin' to get her
to talk, but I said too much.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.117
Hey.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.745

Take this. Take it.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:27.236
That Busan guy. He lookin' for pottery?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.406
I'm not sure.
I only saw him yesterday.

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.867
Can you keep an eye on him
and let me know?

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:39.832
And if I do,
then will you really take me to Seoul?

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.835
'Course. I promise.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.591
Put a stamp on it.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.760
What is this? It's so corny.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.095
-Is this what you do in Seoul?
-Mm-hmm.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.252
Hi, Mr. Song. It's me.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.046
We're gonna start working
so I'll need the expenses--

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:28.839
Gwanseok, we got a big problem.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:30.758
-Everything's about to fall apart.
-What?

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:33.719
Chairman Cheon suddenly
shut his wallet and won't budge.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.888
It's that wife of his, she's too clever.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.723
Look, my hands are tied here.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:41.060
Thing's aren't looking great here, either.

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:43.187
We've got crooks comin' from all over.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:46.315
If we don't move fast,
there's gonna be nothing left for us.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.068
But the money's all dried up
so what should I do?

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.696
Look, we're cut off
and I can't put up what I don't have.

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.490
We're gonna have to
change Cheon's mind somehow.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.243
You're sure
his wife's pulling the strings?

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.703
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.914
I went to talk to her and she said
she's only putting down five million.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.083
That won't even cover the expenses.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:05.501
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.337
And Cheon's eating right out of her hand.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:13.259
Guess we're gonna
have to convince her then.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:14.844
That's exactly right.

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.763
She has to understand
the true value of these damn things.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:18.848
Mr. Song.

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:23.352
Do you think you can get
a nice piece of pottery ready?

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:24.520
What do you mean?

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.110
Where have you been?

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:35.114
Oh, you know, gettin' some fresh air.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.908
-Where are Jeonchul and Daesik?
-I don't know.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.661
Hey, tomorrow,
go to Seoul and talk to Mr. Song.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.912
What for?

00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:43.789
He's gonna give you a ceramic.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:46.208
Once you got it, take it to Cheon's house.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.377
So, a drop-off then?

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.922
When you get there,
give it directly to Mrs. Yang.

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:55.301
And make sure she realizes
how valuable it truly is.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.553
You have to really convince her of it.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.431
What's actually going on here?

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:04.101
Cheon's wife, she's…
making things hard on us.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.187
And she's already got him on her side.

00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:08.731
Everything's riding on you now.

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.276
You get what I'm tryin' to say?

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.696
You have to change her mind.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.366
Whatever it takes. Got it?

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.580
Get on the first train.

00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.890
ORIENTAL ART GALLERY

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.309
When was this from?

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.187
Yuan Dynasty?

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:50.272
Mm-hmm.

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.482
And place of origin?

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:54.193
Uh, was it Yongquan?

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:59.448
Longquan and Jingdezhen!
How many times do I have to--

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:00.574
Jingdezhen. Longquan…

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:01.867
Yeesh. All right.

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.371
Now, what was found there,
what kind of pottery?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.498
Celadon?

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:12.086
Oh! Wait, I know. It was white porcelain.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.921
This is really frustrating,
do you know that?

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.382
Why a gift, all of a sudden?

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.759
What's your uncle even thinking?
What's the big idea?

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:22.179
Ah, shit. What do you want me to do?

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.682
- Come here.
- W-What are you doing?

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:26.142
Just stop moving.

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:32.189
Uh-huh.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:36.193
Wow.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.320
Aren't you somethin'?

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.531
I get it.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:44.326
Real outside-the-box thinking.
Your uncle's a genius.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.249
YONGJIN

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:53.711
This boat's fine.

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:56.130
Why don't we just take this?

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:59.467
I told you.
We'll get caught by the coast guard.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.552
We're gonna need a boat
that's at least this big.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.721
Otherwise, how're we gonna
pull the pottery out?

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:05.264
You tryin' to get us pinched?

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.100
I thought we were supposed to be stealthy.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.729
You really think
your nephew's gonna let you borrow it?

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:14.774
I'll handle it,
so just stay back. All right?

00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:16.358
Yeah, you better.

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:18.778
We've got a perfectly fine boat here.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.449
I was better off doing this alone.

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:27.578 line:20%
JEUNGDO

00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:31.332
Come on. Are you sure
you're adjusting the power properly?

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.167
I already said I was!

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:38.005
Screw this.
The power's not the problem here.

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:40.966
Sangbok!

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:42.968
Hey, Sangbok.

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.679
What? Hey, Uncle!
What brings you here?

00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:47.389
I'm here to see you, man.

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:50.601
- You havin' some engine troubles there?
- I'm goin' crazy over here.

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:51.727
NOH SANGBOK

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.979
Thought it was a busted screw,
but it's something else.

00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:55.064
Oh, dang.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:56.941
So it just stopped runnin'?

00:21:57.024 --> 00:22:00.069
I think can fix it still.
It'll just be a pain in the ass.

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.779
But once I do,
she'll run better than ever.

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:03.906
Yeah? That's good.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.367
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.078
- Come here.
- Well, what is it?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.831
Come on. It's about a job.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.834
Let me get this straight.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:16.919
You not only need my boat
but my motor too?

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.713
That's right. Not tryin' to
pull one over on ya. I'll pay.

00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:21.215
Oh, geez, man.

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:24.552
I guess I'll be pullin' nets
in the middle of farming season.

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:27.012
What? No, you're stayin' here.

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:29.515
Huh? Thought you needed my boat.

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:31.308
Damn straight.

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:33.769
Steerin', I can handle.
You just stay here.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.106
The hell?
It's my boat, so I'm the one who steers.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.440
The hell are you sayin'?

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:40.526
I don't need you, man.

00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:44.196
"You never lend out
your wife or your boat."

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.365
That's what my father
always said to me, 'kay?

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:47.491
You little sh…

00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:50.703
- Hey, I'm your uncle, not some stranger.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:53.831
Anyway, I'm gonna be steerin'.
You just do your job, whatever it is.

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:57.001
My job is to get us there and that's why
I'm steerin'! You deaf all of a sudden?

00:22:57.084 --> 00:23:00.129
Your job should be foolin' around with
girls 'cause that's all you're good at.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.047
What was that?

00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:05.092
You wanna repeat that, huh?
Yeah, yeah, come here, come here.

00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:06.427
-Say that again.
-All right then.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.387
-What are you doing?
-Stay out of it, okay?

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.432
-I already told you I'd handle it.
-Hey, I want you to shut up now.

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.767
Just give him the 50,000.

00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:18.606
I won't give him shit. Why would
I give that little asshole anythin'

00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:20.149
when I can get it for free--

00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:23.819
We're gonna wrap this shit up now.
I don't want any trouble.

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:28.949
Hey, hey.

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.659
- Come here for a sec.
- Still not workin'? No?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.203
- Get your butt over here.
- Ah, shit.

00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:36.582
Hey, could I have a word with you?

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.126
What is it this time, huh?

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.553
A walk or somethin'
would be nice, ya know?

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:51.055
We're not gettin' any customers.

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:53.974
You're only gonna get hungry
if you go for a walk.

00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:55.726
I feel like I need the exercise.

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.978
I have indigestion from sittin' all day.

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.356
Let's talk in here.

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:01.565
Oh, hi there!

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:03.442
Hey.

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:06.528
Dang. What is this, a church?
Why's it so quiet in here?

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:09.114
So,
how do you guys know each other?

00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:10.240
Huh?

00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:14.161
Ah, well,
we just got some business.

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:17.039
Ooh, you've got some business.

00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:20.084
All right, enough. You can go.

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:22.378
Hey. Seonja.

00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:26.966
I want a cup of coffee.

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:29.468
I like it sweet. You know what I mean?

00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:37.851
Oh, and make it two cups, all right?

00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:38.978
Hey, girl.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.440
-Come over here.
-What?

00:24:43.524 --> 00:24:44.900
I said come here.

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:56.161
So…

00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:02.376
Do you like hoe?
Should I take you out for some?

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:05.963
Nah, this girl doesn't really like fish.

00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:08.966
How about… I bet you like pork?

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:12.302
Seonja, tell the Professor
you don't like pork.

00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:13.637
Hey.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.015
Stay out of it.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.977
So what do you like to eat then?

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.520
Nothin'. I'm always full.

00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:22.604
Oh, yeah?

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:25.190
Come on then. Let's have a drink.

00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:26.608
You have a death wish?

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:28.110
Hey.

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.654
It's just a drink.
Let's not lose our heads here.

00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:32.906
The coffee we got
ain't that good, you know.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.576
It's true.
The shop across the street's way better.

00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:38.871
What do you think you're sayin', Seonja?

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:42.082
Hey. Hang on.
Just give me a second.

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:50.591
So… …some Seoul folks are in town?

00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:57.222
- Wow.
- Here.

00:25:58.599 --> 00:25:59.600 line:20%
ONE THOUSAND WON

00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:02.436
Let's be friends.
We can all get along, right?

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:05.564
Ooh. Lucky me! Lucky me!

00:26:05.647 --> 00:26:07.566
Hey, hey, hey! You have to share that!

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:09.443
Split it, okay?

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:11.487
Silly girl.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:13.322
Drink.

00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:26.085
CHEON HWANGSIK

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:28.545
"Cheon Hwangsik."

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.342
Who is it?

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:37.221
Hi. I'm actually here
to drop something off for the missus.

00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:38.555
O-Okay. Just a moment.

00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:39.932
Cool.

00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:45.896
If she asks what this is,
just tell her it's worth a lot.

00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:49.024
And if she asks why you brought her this,

00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:54.404
gaze directly into her eyes
and say it's a gift just for her.

00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:03.747
- Hi there.
- Uh…

00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:05.082
Who are you?

00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:08.001
I'm from Insa-dong.
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Song.

00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:09.419
I brought this gift for her.

00:27:09.503 --> 00:27:11.130
-Oh, here I'll take it to--
-It's valuable,

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:12.923
so I'd rather give it to her.

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:19.096
Um, Mrs. Yang!
There's a package for you here!

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.180
What is it?

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:23.350
Uh… Something valuable, he says!

00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:25.519
-Insa-dong, right?
-Yeah, that's right.

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:27.563
He says he's from Insa-dong!

00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:29.523
Okay, let him in!

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.025
- R-Right this way.
- Thanks.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.412
Wow, this is killer.

00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:46.039
Mrs. Yang.

00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:53.797
Hi. It's been a while.

00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:55.090
Yeah, it has.

00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:01.597
Can't believe that rat bastard
took 50,000 from us

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.932
just so we could take his boat out
for a little while.

00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:06.184
You really don't know
how to get things done, huh?

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.020
- Sir.
- Hey.

00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:10.689
After all that big talk…

00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:12.357
Heedong isn't with you?

00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:13.984
I sent him to Seoul.

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:15.068
To Seoul?

00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:20.449
Hey, I wanna ask
about Cheon's missus.

00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:22.576
What?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.787
Well, she keeps tryin'
to knock down the price on us.

00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:28.165
She does?

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.709
I know you're already aware,
but things aren't good here.

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:33.170
At this point it's a bust.

00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.255
We've gotta get her to change her mind.

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:39.968
I mean, is there anything you can tell me
about her personality?

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.014
I don't know. When it comes to money,
she's pretty tough.

00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:46.850
Handling money is her favorite thing.

00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:49.394
That's the whole reason
she caught Chairman Cheon's eye.

00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:55.275
Damn. And it's not like I can
just change her mind with a young stud.

00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:59.738
Do you think that old man
ever leaves her alone?

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:04.201
He's always got a rough looking guy
following her everywhere she goes.

00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.503
So what's the occasion?

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:17.798
Right, well,
Mr. Song told me to bring this here.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.591
What is it?

00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:22.552
It's a gift for you.

00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:25.055
It's pretty valuable.

00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:27.933
Oh, you started digging?

00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:30.477
Uh, no, this isn't that.

00:29:30.978 --> 00:29:33.814
He wants you to have this rare piece,
as a present.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.024
- A present?
- Yeah.

00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:40.237
Does he really have the time
to send over gifts like this?

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.323
Is this genuine?

00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:45.993
It's from Yongquan, Yuan Dynasty.

00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:47.911
Chinese pottery
from the Yuan Dynasty?

00:29:47.995 --> 00:29:49.788
It's a really valuable piece.

00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.748
Is it really worth that much?

00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:53.959
What do you think of it?

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:57.129
Uh, I think it'd be pretty
with flowers in it.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:03.802
You must be bored down there
if you had the time to bring me this.

00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:05.387
Shouldn't you be digging?

00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.265
Wh-What?

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.813
Go and tell Mr. Song
I appreciate the gesture.

00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.691
I guess he's trying to size me up.

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:21.862
But I'm not the type of person
who forgets an excessive gift.

00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:24.322
And I might be in the mood
to send him one in return.

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:29.036
Answer me if you understand.

00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:32.289
Yeah.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.708
You can go.

00:30:56.646 --> 00:30:58.273
Ugh, what the hell was that?

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.858
Shit.

00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:01.610
- Uh, wait a minute!
- Huh?

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.945
She wanted you to take this.

00:31:07.324 --> 00:31:08.992
5 P.M. TODAY
MARILYN BOUTIQUE, JONGNO

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:13.538
It actually worked?

00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:23.799
What does he take me for?

00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:31.014
-I have a meeting with the girls later.
-Oh. Right.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.183
- When is it?
- Five o'clock.

00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:35.977
The madam from Gahoe-dong
and I are going to go together.

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:37.270
I'll stay nearby then.

00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:40.398
You're just going to make her feel
uncomfortable hovering like that.

00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:43.860
- Even still…
- I'll let the chairman know then,

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:47.114
how you guys ruined the meeting
by not reading the room.

00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:09.803
MARILYN BOUTIQUE

00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:15.517
Hi. Welcome in.

00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:19.479
Hello there.
I'm actually meeting someone here.

00:32:19.563 --> 00:32:20.856
Ah.

00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:24.276
-Mokpo?
-Yeah.

00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:26.570
Right this way, sir.

00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:32.826
It's that room.

00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:49.718
Come in.

00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:07.277
You're the present, right?

00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:10.864
Uh…

00:33:12.616 --> 00:33:13.783
Yeah.

00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:16.953
Just be natural.

00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:18.455
Make love to me.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.374
Sorry?

00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:23.376
As if we're in a relationship.

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.129
I want to be held by you.

00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:32.928
You don't want to?

00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:37.390
N-no, that's not it.

00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:40.727
It's just… I mean, it's a little…

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.480
Then…
you want to talk first?

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:46.900
But we don't have anything
to talk about, do we?

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.403
Do you do this a lot?

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:54.824
I mean, if you were going to do this,
you didn't have to break the vase.

00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:58.912
I did that so the chairman will think
I put Song in his place.

00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:01.331
I got you off his radar.

00:34:03.124 --> 00:34:04.751
You know how many eyes there were on us?

00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:10.757
Hold me.

00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:36.116
Step back.

00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:53.717
I got it.

00:34:58.388 --> 00:35:00.015
Wait, what is this?

00:35:30.045 --> 00:35:31.630
I bet your uncle sent you.

00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:37.344
He seems anything but ordinary.

00:35:39.512 --> 00:35:41.139
What was his job before this?

00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.101
Well, you know. This and that.

00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:48.813
You want a drink?

00:36:24.224 --> 00:36:26.184
That's really strong.

00:36:27.727 --> 00:36:29.521
First time trying whiskey?

00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:30.730
Uh, yeah.

00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.836
This is
where we'll need to anchor the boat,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.507
but the current there's pretty strong,
so I don't know how it'll go.

00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:24.844
Since our boat's tiny, those waves
are gonna beat it up real hard.

00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:25.929
Mmm.

00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:28.556
First we should pack
and then head over to Jeungdo.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.892
We gotta wait
for the right moment.

00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:34.395
- Hmm.
- Hey, Seokbae.

00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:36.648
You okay with divin' alone?

00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:39.651
What do you mean?
When the hell I say I was gonna do it?

00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:43.112
You came this far. Just do it.
What are you draggin' your feet for?

00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:46.407
Hey, I'm only here 'cause
you caused a damn scene the other day.

00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:48.326
Cops are already on my ass.

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:50.578
-I got enough to deal with.
-Hey, listen, idiot.

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:54.207
-I already told you you're gonna get paid.
-How much are we even talkin' here?

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.459
And if I get pinched,
who's taking care of my kid?

00:38:56.543 --> 00:38:58.795
All right, all right.
Here's how we're doin' it.

00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:01.422
Our crew keeps getting bigger,

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.550
and I'm starting to run low on funds here.

00:39:03.633 --> 00:39:05.844
So, we're gonna split the profits.

00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:08.805
Captain, forget the amount we agreed on.

00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.224
If we hit it big, we all hit it big.

00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:12.725
If we bust, we all bust.

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:13.810
Sound good?

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:17.230
Yeah, sounds good. Sure.

00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:20.567
It's better if the stakes are
the same for us all anyway.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.360
All right. Let's do that.

00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:24.821
Uh, I think I should ask Mr. Song first.

00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:27.365
I'll handle your shares myself.
What about you?

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:33.037
Cryin' out loud.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.748
Once you're in the water,
you're blind as all get out.

00:39:35.832 --> 00:39:37.292
You can't see a thing.

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.252
That's why you gotta drag your feet along.

00:39:39.335 --> 00:39:41.838
Like this, all right? Just like this.

00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:44.674
And then, "clink, clink."

00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:46.134
Once you hear that sound,

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.428
that's when you gotta get down,
start feelin' with your hands.

00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:50.889
Figure out what it is.
Could be just a coin.

00:39:50.972 --> 00:39:52.348
There are coins down there?

00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:55.602
In order to balance the ship,
they loaded it with coins.

00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:58.438
So how many can you carry yourself?

00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:01.316
Well, uh,
that's gonna take a while, I think.

00:40:02.358 --> 00:40:04.402
The current's pretty strong in that area.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:07.405
Can't even dive on some of those days.

00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:09.782
How many do you think
you can pull out in one dive then?

00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:13.786
Well, I've only got two hands,
so then I'm guessing, I can get two.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.831
And after a few dives,
your back is done for.

00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.333
Water's really heavy down there.

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:20.460
How are we supposed to get
a thousand at this rate?

00:40:22.921 --> 00:40:24.255
Uh, well, let's see…

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:26.883
Seokbae, you take a net down there,

00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:29.761
and put them in,
and we can just haul it up then.

00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:31.638
No way, they're too fragile.

00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:33.723
The pottery's gonna break.

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:35.600
They've been in the water too long.

00:40:35.683 --> 00:40:37.143
Exactly.

00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:38.853
We can do it carefully.

00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:40.396
We don't have a choice.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.274
We gotta grab as much as we can.

00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:46.194
Should we bring in more divers?

00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:49.822
And how much would that cost us?
Forget it.

00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:53.743
Look, when they first found the pottery,
they were all hauled up in nets,

00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:56.120
and it was all okay. Just dandy.

00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:58.706
By the way,
where are we supposed to dig?

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.875
We don't know where the spot is, do we?

00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:05.004
Well, Seokbae and I will
just keep searching 'round the area,

00:41:05.088 --> 00:41:06.881
and we're bound to find somethin' there.

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:08.800
You really wanna dive down?

00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:12.053
This isn't some beachside swim, you know.

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:15.598
What are you sayin'?
I've spent my whole life in the sea, man.

00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:17.308
The pressure could kill you, bud.

00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:19.394
One wrong move and your eardrums can go.

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.021
I said I'll go.
I'll dive in right here.

00:41:22.105 --> 00:41:26.192
I'll dive with you, ya understand?
So just quit your yappin' already!

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.904
- Huh?
- Thinkin' I can't dive…

00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:30.989
Taesan…

00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:34.033
You shut your mouth
and look for the damn spot.

00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:36.828
- Captain Hwang.
- Come on.

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.371
What a nasty temper.

00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.248
What's his problem?
Just worried about him.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.458
- Oh, boy.
- Geez, what an ass.

00:41:42.959 --> 00:41:44.711
- Is that better?
- Just keep goin'.

00:41:44.794 --> 00:41:48.006
- Oh, that's good. Oh, wow.
- Here? All right.

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:49.090
Hey.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.758
- Yeah?
- Have you boys eaten yet?

00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:51.843
It's fine.

00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:54.554
Here. Go get yourselves some lunch.

00:41:54.637 --> 00:41:56.931
- Come on, Ma. Put that away.
- Ah, no, no, ma'am.

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:58.307
-Come on, take it.
-No. Thanks, ma'am.

00:41:58.391 --> 00:41:59.517
We can buy our own food.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.436
Hey, look. Over by that stand.

00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:03.646
It's Taesan.

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.899
Hey, Ma, I've got to go now.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.818
-Rest your shoulders, 'kay?
-Yeah. All right.

00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:10.403
-See ya later, ma'am.
-Next time, ma'am.

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:13.031
'Kay, boys.
Don't go skippin' meals now, ya hear?

00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:14.741
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah, I hear you.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.578
- How you doin'?
- Where you kids goin'?

00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:19.746
We got work to do.

00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:22.165
What kinda work?

00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:27.628
We all need money, right?
And since you're not giving us any work…

00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:29.630
Pretty disappointed here,
you know?

00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:33.843
Because well, you kept telling us
you were gonna let us in on some big deal,

00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:35.678
and then we all got kicked to the curb.

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:38.598
Fuck's sake, y'all are
talkin' nonsense.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.267
Look like I'm rakin' it in?

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:44.520
Dang. Something go wrong?

00:42:45.104 --> 00:42:47.774
What happened? Did those guys
screw you over or something?

00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:52.737
It's not like that.

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.822
Anyway, it's a mess.

00:42:55.531 --> 00:42:56.949
Oh, no.

00:42:57.033 --> 00:42:59.285
Sounds like
you're goin' through some shit.

00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:00.369
Well then,

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:03.164
here's hopin' you land on your feet.

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.291
Catch you around.

00:43:05.374 --> 00:43:07.460
- Cigarette. Now.
- Here.

00:43:08.086 --> 00:43:11.422
Hey, good luck.

00:43:11.506 --> 00:43:13.007
-We'll see you around!
-Leave her out of this.

00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:15.134
- See ya!
- Hey. Rude.

00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:18.930
Those lil assholes can go fuck themselves.
I was still talkin'.

00:43:28.898 --> 00:43:30.483
How you doin' today, ma'am?

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:31.567
Hey.

00:43:38.157 --> 00:43:40.701
About how long do you have to
hold your breath on a dive?

00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.538
You're tryin'
to hold your breath on a deep dive?

00:43:43.913 --> 00:43:46.165
Bet you'll die
on your way up from the bottom.

00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:49.293
I can hold my breath for a long time,
ya know.

00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:53.589
You can keep holding your breath
and you'll never make it back.

00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:56.843
You wouldn't even reach the bottom,
I reckon.

00:43:59.095 --> 00:44:00.638
What if I use an air tank?

00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:02.014
How deep are you goin' down?

00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:03.474
Twenty meters, give or take.

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:04.976
Yeah?

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:08.354
Then you'll die swimmin'
with a 20-kilo tank on your back.

00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:10.898
I'm willin' to bet you think
this is easier than it looks

00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:13.067
because people like me dive all the time.

00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:26.122
- See you later, 'kay?
- All right.

00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:41.554
It was nice talking to you today.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.181
Uh-huh.

00:44:44.056 --> 00:44:45.141
-Oh, Jin.
-Hmm?

00:44:45.224 --> 00:44:47.018
-Can you fix him up a new outfit?
-Sure.

00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:48.936
Oh, you don't have to. I-It's fine.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.188
Just take it.

00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:52.106
Consider it payment for the vase.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.942
-Get him something nice.
-I'll make him look dapper.

00:44:57.653 --> 00:44:59.822
Once this is over,
do you want a proper job?

00:45:00.323 --> 00:45:01.824
I can get you work at the company.

00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:03.701
Uh, thanks. I'm okay.

00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:06.287
Think about it.
It could be a good opportunity.

00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:12.668
So anyway, what about, you know, our deal?

00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:16.088
I'll work on it, okay?

00:45:17.632 --> 00:45:19.508
- See you later.
- Bye now.

00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:28.434 line:20%
MOKPO PRISON

00:45:31.687 --> 00:45:33.481
3842, visitor.

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.149
Huh? What?

00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:37.068
You got a visitor.
Come on, just wrap it up.

00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:40.071
Dang, can't a guy take a shit around here?

00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:41.239
Who is it?

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:43.991
Whoa.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.955
This blade's a real masterpiece, isn't it?

00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:52.583
One of my clients
is a member of the yakuza.

00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:56.170
I fixed him up with a real nice piece,
and he gave me that sword as a present.

00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:59.840
It's true.
Their swords are on another level.

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.509
This blade…

00:46:02.218 --> 00:46:03.302
Dang, that looks sharp.

00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:06.097
- Hey, hey! Easy there, easy.
- Settle, man.

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:07.974
Warden, sir,

00:46:08.057 --> 00:46:11.310
this katana is from the Edo period.

00:46:11.394 --> 00:46:13.479
The blade alone is worth a million.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.314
Really now?

00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:17.692
That's some serious money.

00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:21.112
Yeah?

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:29.203
- Sir!
- Yeah.

00:46:30.413 --> 00:46:31.998
Look at you. You're eatin' well.

00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:33.249
How's prison been?

00:46:33.332 --> 00:46:35.167
What are you doing here?

00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:36.419
Man, you have to ask?

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:39.755
Hey, I thought
you were havin' a rough time in here.

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:42.758
Instead, you're lookin' plump
like a pomfret in peak season.

00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:44.760
I guess prison life suits you.

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.722
You're really talkin' your shit, ain't ya?

00:46:48.306 --> 00:46:51.350
Okay. Uh, you there.
Go get his clothes, okay?

00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:53.894
- Sir?
- Look,

00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:57.064
I'm granting him a temporary release.
So go on and get 'em.

00:46:57.148 --> 00:46:58.149
I'm sorry, uh…

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:00.693
I'm not sure I understand.

00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:02.987
I know you're not talking back right now!

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:06.198
I said I'm granting it!
What's there to understand?

00:47:06.282 --> 00:47:07.575
Oh, r-right.

00:47:09.035 --> 00:47:10.202
Yes, sir.

00:47:10.286 --> 00:47:13.789
That damn moron, I swear…

00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:15.791
Yo, chief. Mind if I smoke in here?

00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:17.418
Sure, of course.

00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:20.296
So, am I gettin' out?

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.341
What? They're here to pick you up,
so yeah.

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:29.096
So, what are we thinking?
Is two weeks good?

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.057
Two weeks should be more than enough.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.685
Enough to turn a skinny man
into a fat ass, isn't it?

00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:38.105
Listen, you better get back on time.

00:47:38.189 --> 00:47:41.150
If your ass is late by even a second,
you're toast, got it?

00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:44.862
I don't know
what the fuck is going on here.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.532
I never said I wanted out.

00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:51.327
This guy… He's one nasty bastard.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.912
Be careful.

00:47:54.914 --> 00:47:58.084
So, listen, from here on,
I'm the boss.

00:47:58.167 --> 00:47:59.502
You are?

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:01.962
Now, how is that?

00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:08.511
The fuck? You're real clueless.
You don't know what kinda guy I am.

00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.012
Right.

00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:16.477
'Kay, listen carefully.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.189
If you act in a way I don't like,

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:24.402
then I'll smash your damn brains in.
Got it?

00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:27.655
Huh?

00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:37.373
Give me a one-two.

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:39.583
The hell's goin' on?

00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:41.752
You fucking idiot.
Keep your hands up.

00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:43.963
- Don't. Fuck.
- Put your fucking feet there.

00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:45.881
Stop. What the hell?

00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:47.049
Well, help him.

00:48:49.218 --> 00:48:51.262
Huh?

00:48:51.345 --> 00:48:53.514
- That bastard.
- He's nobody.

00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:55.349
Why the hell is he out?

00:48:58.853 --> 00:49:00.146
I'll see you around.

00:49:02.648 --> 00:49:05.568
Why does he feel the need
to start shit with me for no reason?

00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:07.361
-Daesik.
-Oh.

00:49:08.404 --> 00:49:09.488
Hi, sir.

00:49:09.572 --> 00:49:10.698
What was that?

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:12.992
What are you doin'
hangin' out with those guys?

00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:15.119
I-I was heading to the inn
when they showed up.

00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:17.496
How did Bokgeun get out?

00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:20.416
- Wh-Who?
- Hey, guys.

00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:21.500
Hey.

00:49:22.877 --> 00:49:24.670
I just saw Bokgeun walkin' around here.

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.173
How the hell did he get out?

00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:29.967
It must've been Professor Kim.

00:49:30.843 --> 00:49:32.344
By the way, your boys were there.

00:49:33.596 --> 00:49:36.432
Those little shits must be tryin'
to mess with our meal ticket.

00:49:36.515 --> 00:49:38.225
Motherfuckers, I swear…

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:39.310
Just stay cool.

00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:42.605
We should go out there first
and scout the area.

00:49:42.688 --> 00:49:44.190
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:49:44.273 --> 00:49:45.816
Wait, we're goin' right now?

00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.152
We gotta hurry.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.345
All right. If you knock this
over, we're going on a date.

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:15.888
Yeah, keep dreamin'.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.892
Third cousin guy!

00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:22.019
You're lookin'
as handsome as always.

00:50:22.102 --> 00:50:24.063
Uh, I just got in actually.

00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:26.690
Oh, never the one
for standin' still, are you?

00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:28.275
Yeah. Uh, where's the madam?

00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:31.487
Why are you lookin' for her?
I'm standin' right here.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.405
You like 'em older, don't you?

00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:35.199
Meaning what?

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:36.784
Hey.

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.746
Can I talk to you for a bit?

00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:43.165
- About what?
- Let's get some hoe.

00:50:43.249 --> 00:50:44.875
What? This is sudden.

00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:46.835
I said I'd buy you some the other day.

00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:47.920
Do you not want to?

00:50:48.546 --> 00:50:50.339
What's this? You remembered your promise?

00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:52.091
Hey, hey. What about me, huh?

00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:54.468
Uh, you gotta watch the café.

00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.136
What are you talkin' about?

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.097
Where do you think you're goin'?
What about work?

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.808
Well, I don't think
that Ms. Jang's gonna come in today.

00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:04.436
And even if she does, I'm not feelin' well
so I went to the doctor.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.730
If you get caught,
Ms. Jang's gonna kill ya, ya know.

00:51:06.814 --> 00:51:08.899
Come on, I'll be right back.
It's right there.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.818
Let's go.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.698
- Wait, Seonja!
- Hold down the fort.

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:18.325
Damn it.

00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:22.204
When the hell did those two
start bein' a thing?

00:51:22.288 --> 00:51:24.832
Ugh, shit. Oh, there he is.

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:27.585
What's the rush? What's happening?

00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:31.964
-Let's go out there and find the spot.
-Seokbae, you can find it, right?

00:51:32.047 --> 00:51:34.383
Ah, shit, I already said I couldn't!

00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:37.261
Well, then try to, man,
instead of just sayin' you can't remember!

00:51:37.344 --> 00:51:39.847
What am I supposed to say to you here,
huh? Want me to lie to you, bud?

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.599
- You…
- The problem is

00:51:41.682 --> 00:51:44.226
there are other guys here,
so we gotta find it first.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:46.604
Yeah, but it's-it's gonna
get dark real soon.

00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:49.565
- I mean, you even bring a light?
- I got it, so let's get goin'.

00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:53.527
- Let's head out. Come on, hurry.
- All right! Let's do this!

00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:54.945
Wait, whose boat is this?

00:51:55.029 --> 00:51:56.113
It's Sangbok's.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:51:57.615 --> 00:52:00.576
Wait, is this… I don't think
it's safe with all of us here.

00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:03.329
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

00:52:03.412 --> 00:52:04.955
Watch your balance.

00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:06.373
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa!

00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:08.042
Easy, easy, easy!

00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:12.838
Is it supposed to be this far?

00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:14.632
Yeah, it's far.

00:52:14.715 --> 00:52:17.968
From Mokpo, it should take
at least two hours.

00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:22.723
Guess we'll have to stop at Jeungdo then.
To find a place to stay!

00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:25.517
-Hey, Seokbae!
-What?

00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:27.686
You got a shed in Jeungdo, right?

00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.314
Why are you askin' about that now?

00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:32.066
Let us use it for a night!

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:35.486
This asshole never quits.
That's my shed, not yours, damn it!

00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:38.656
Hey, come on.
Why are you always so stingy?

00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:43.035
Not like it's solid gold or nothin'!
We sure we got our bearings?

00:52:44.286 --> 00:52:45.704
Yeah, of course we do!

00:52:46.455 --> 00:52:47.790
I think Dodeokdo was…

00:52:48.374 --> 00:52:50.250
I think I saw it right over there!

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.630
Keep your damn eyes peeled!

00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:58.425
Ugh, it's dark and cold as shit!
I can't see a damn thing.

00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:01.595
Dang!
That's a strong current there!

00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:04.473
If you fall in, you'll get swept away.

00:53:05.057 --> 00:53:06.266
Man.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.686
- Wait, what's that?
- Huh?

00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:11.146
That looks like a boat,
doesn't it?

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.691
Uh, is that the coast guard?

00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:16.944
No way. You think the coast
guard would ride around in a skiff?

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:19.530
- Point the light over there.
- Okay.

00:53:24.743 --> 00:53:26.912
Hey! Who's out there?

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:34.253
Dang, you guys scared me.

00:53:35.421 --> 00:53:37.965 line:20%
What is this?
Some kind of midnight fish market?

00:53:39.133 --> 00:53:40.843 line:20%
Ooh, what have we got here?

00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:42.720 line:20%
All the assholes in one place, huh?

00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:50.185
What the heck? The Professor?
