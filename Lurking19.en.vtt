You said you don't love me.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200
Why didn't you push away?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.800
I forgot.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.919
You've always been such a bad guy.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.159
(I can't go back to my room.)

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.800
(I should just go home.)

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.319
I see.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.800
I'll be there.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.800
Brother, have you seen Song Qian?

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.319
Didn't I tell you to warn him

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.719
to stay away from Gu Nian?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.520
Gu Nian?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.159
They're together again?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.199
Wei Qing,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.280
If you can't handle your own man,

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.639
don't blame me for dealing with him.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.639
No!

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.439
Song Qian has helped you a lot.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.719
Remember.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.360
This is the last time.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.960
Come with me.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.879
Why did you bring me to your room?

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.639
I'm going back.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.240
You wouldn't still be outside

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.479
if you actually wanted to go back.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.879
You can be with anyone you want,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.479
just not with Zhou Shen.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.759
Did you already know

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.199
that Zhou Shen is connected
to the Wei Group?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.520
(He is related to my mom
and the dean's death.)

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.400
So he was lying to me all along.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.400
But he's looking for me now.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.759
What should I do?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.520
Don't worry.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.240
He won't have time for you later.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.639
Why?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.399
I won't let you

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.639
stay in the same room with him.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.240
You'll stay in my room tonight.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:28.439
And you and Wei Qing?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.600
We don't stay in the same room.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.720
Don't worry.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.000
I'll stay in another hotel later.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:40.199
Qian?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.040
Qian?

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:45.800
Qian,

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.120
what are you doing?

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.079
Why are you here?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.839
Aren't you inviting me in
for a drink of water?

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.319
How about

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.600
we go to your room?

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.519
Sure.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.120
Let's go.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.839
(Gu Nian,)

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.839
(give me a little more time.)

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.160
(I will take care of everything.)

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.400
(Wei Group)

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.439
Sir,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.240
Wei Group hasn't
delivered the raw materials yet.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.439
We can't start work.

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.759
So it really is you.

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.360
The chemist.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.319
Leave now.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.560
You seem

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.920
not surprised.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.000
When did you figure it out?

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.759
(The night Zhao Yan was hit,)

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.079
(you suddenly showed up.)

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.319
(Shortly after,
Gu Nian's place was searched.)

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.040
(But what convinced me was)

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.160
(I gave the tracking bracelet from you)

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:01.759
(to Gu Nian in Tai City.)

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.639
(But when she returned it to me,)

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.399
(Peng Li's chip I secretly put in)

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.639
(during our escape was already gone.)

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:11.319
(Only someone close to her
could get the chip)

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.319
(without raising her suspicion.)

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.160
To see me,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.600
you made quite a stir.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.120
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.959
If you do,

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.439
who else can you
make such a good scapegoat?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.240
What do you want?

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.199
To make drugs.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.720
Fine.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.120
Stay away from Gu Nian.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:36.839
What?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.240
You can't do it?

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:42.759
Of course I can.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.319
It's just a woman.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.680
(I found a hospital building plan
on Zhou Shen's laptop.)

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.839
Strangely, this plan shows
there's a mezzanine.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.759
If the hospital really has a mezzanine,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.040
it explains how Zhao Yan managed

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.639
to disappear from the hospital.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.079
(So this elevator card)

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.879
(should be the key.)

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.600
(What exactly is this place?)

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.240
(This is a drug factory?)

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.639
(My mom and the dean got killed)

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:11.759
(after they found out here?)

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.399
Who are you? Stop.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.200
I'm new here.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.559
New here?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.399
Turn around.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:37.840
Someone broke in.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.960
She ran to the elevator.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.320
After her!

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.000
Don't let her get away.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:09:59.120
Nian.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.759
Why are you here?

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:08.279
You said you were unwell.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.720
So I rushed over to your place.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.120
But you weren't at home.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:13.120
I figured you might be here.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.039
Are you feeling unwell?

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:18.519
You're sweating so much.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:19.360
I'm much better now.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.840
Then let me take you home.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.679
No need. I have something to do.
I'm leaving.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.039
(I need to get out of here quickly.)

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.720
Let go of me! Help!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.960
Let me go!

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:49.679
Don't move.

00:10:57.879 --> 00:10:58.799
What are you doing?

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.440
Mind your position!

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.559
Gu Nian already knows
about the hospital's mezzanine.

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:14.440
So

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.919
she can't live.

00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:23.296
Hello.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:25.639
Can you locate Gu Nian?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.879
The informant found her.

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.320
I'll send you the location.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.360
When will the police act?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.200
Support is on the way. Don't be rash.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.720
I can't wait.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.039
She can't be pulled into this.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.039
What's your plan?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.639
Do you want to act alone?

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.639
Don't mess around.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.399
Qian, I've been looking for you.

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.600
What are you doing here?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.399
Weren't we supposed
to try on wedding dresses together?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.559
I'm sorry.

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:52.399
I've been busy.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.080
Where are you going?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.399
You're going to find Gu Nian, right?

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.919
No.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.519
I need to be away for a few days.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.399
Will you make it back in time
for the wedding next week?

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.960
Don't worry. I'll be there.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.440
What's that noise?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.399
Who are you?

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.679
Who exactly are you?

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.320
Come with me. I'll get you out.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.960
Where do you think you are going?

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:09.720
Let's go.

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:11.919
Don't move.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:27.480
Stop.
