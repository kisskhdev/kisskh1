Khem said goodbye to me

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
and canceled the agreement.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920
Kwanrin.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.160
Khem is staying with you, isn't she?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.440
She's not with me.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.120
Please, Dad.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.240
I need her.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.500
I love her.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.800
Do you hear that I love her?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.640
Can you please help me find Khem?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.680
I love Khem. Do you hear me?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.760
Can you please come back to me?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.160
Stop speaking falsely about Prapai

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.320
and get out of here.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.320
I no longer want to see your face.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Take care, Rin.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.680
Let's have dinner with me.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.000
I don't want to.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.440
I'm not hungry.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.280
You've lost a lot of weight, Rin.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.360
Let's go and have something.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.200
Then I'll tell you where she is.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.400
You've found her?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.800
Take a shower.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.760
Dress up

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.080
and come have a meal with me.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.920
After that, let's bring her home.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.840
Promise?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.920
Thank you, Dad.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120
Are you full?

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.360
That's nice.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.560
Now, I'll fulfill the promise.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.840
Please have a seat.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.600
Kwanrin's paying us a visit.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.880
She's going to tell me where Khem is.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.440
Mr. Wasin actually has been asking me
several times already

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.440
to get me to tell him where Khem is.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.720
Yet, every time, I lied

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.560
and said I had no idea.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.640
I'm sorry for keeping you
waiting until now.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.600
You actually did that, Dad?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.640
Rin,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.360
I'm really scared, dear.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.760
I almost lost you once,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.880
and I'm not gonna let it happen again.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.060
If something were to happen to you,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.960
I wouldn't be able to go on.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.200
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.040
I promise that no matter what happens
from now on,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.000
I won't do it again.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.840
That's all I ask.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.080
Kwanrin.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.160
Can you please tell me

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.520
where Khem is?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.800
Khem actually told me
not to tell you where she is.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.240
I've also promised that I wouldn't,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.400
but I don't want her
to suffer forever either.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.400
So...

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.000
I'll tell you where Khem is.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.080
These are all the details
I have about where she is.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.120
The reason I'm telling you
everything today is that

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.080
if I were to tell you later,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.280
you might not get to see her again.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.520
What do you mean?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.920
She's moving overseas.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.240
If you choose to go after her today,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.200
you'll still be able to find her.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.480
Thank you very much, Kwanrin.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.640
I promise I'll do my best

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.560
to bring her back home.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.320
Thank you, Dad.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.320
Thank you.

Since when did you start drinking?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.480

Yes.

Can you please wear it once again?

I want to wear it with you

I miss you, too.

I really miss you, Rin.

Sure.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.080
I'm so happy that we're going home.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.200
You were the one
to run away from me, though.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.600
Did you know that?

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.400
At that time, I didn't.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.680
Now, I know that

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.480
if I were to run away from you again,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.160
you'd go out there and eventually find me.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.960
Are you sure you can simply
slip from my grasp?

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.680
You're heading home, aren't you, Khem?

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.440
Please don't be mad at me
for telling Rin where you were.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.840
I am not.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.960
I owe you, actually.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.840
Are you going to work at the same company?

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.400
It's a shame because you secured
a very nice position there.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.640
I'm still not sure about that.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.800
I might have to reapply,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.880
but I'm not sure if the CEO will let me in.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.000
If that's the case,
I'd better pray for you.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.560
Good luck, Khem.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.880
Take care of Rin, too, okay?

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.630
Yes, Kwanrin.

I'm sorry.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.280
I quit the job
without really thinking it through.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.520
Is there any chance
I can go back to work there?

Yes.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.640
If you want to, just go for it.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.120

It's going to be a joyful

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.920
and satisfying one.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.460
I'm sure that you won't want it to end.

Hey, Khem.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440
You're talking too much.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.480
Just sit still and be quiet.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.240
We're almost home, you know?

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.000
Hello, Dad.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.760
You're finally home, Khem.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.560
Feeling better now?

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.320
Yes, I'm better than ever.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.080
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.720
Rin and I have finally reconciled,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.120
and we have no hard feelings
toward each other.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.000
We've talked things through

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.000
and agreed that there will be
no obligations in our marriage,

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.640
along with a 2-year agreement
to secure the role of president.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.600
We're simply going to live
as a real married couple.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.280
From now on,
may your relationship be smooth sailing.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.400
If there's a problem,
please stay calm, talk it out,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.080
make changes, and learn from each other.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.720
Right.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.800
From now on, please stop drinking.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.840
I want you to live a happy life.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.400
If I had known you'd be drinking this much,

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.320
I would've come back to your arms that day.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.400
Well...

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.960
Don't try slipping away from me again.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.560
Stay with me.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.080
Understand?

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.200
I understand.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.040
Well then,

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.720
how about we do something fun
to take our minds off it?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.760
Hold on...

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.120
Before returning home, we'd already...

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.000
Nope, I mean...

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.680
Shall we make dinner?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.760
I want to spend a lot of time
doing fun things with you.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.080
You!

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.620
You still can't stop teasing me, can you?

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.320
Let's make dinner.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.480
Please?

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840
Please.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.240
Okay, okay.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.480
But...

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.680
Don't mess up the kitchen, alright?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.790
- Shall we?
- Let's go!

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680
It smells so nice.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.200
You know how to make Thai clear soup?

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.400
Of course, I do.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.440
I've trained with the housemaids.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.120
It tastes exactly the same
as what you had at a restaurant.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920
How is it?

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.240
This is so good!

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.680
Of course.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.920
The secret ingredient I added is love.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.880
Uh, is it okay if I ask

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.960
why you enjoy omelets so much,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.840
even though they're such a simple dish?

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.360
Well...

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.560
When I was little,
after coming home from school,

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.080
my mom would always make me omelets.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.880
That's why I love them so much.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.240
My mom also loved making me dishes
when I got home from school.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.640
She knew how to make a ton of dishes, too.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.120
I had to take extra classes,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.600
and when I got home,
I'd be so, so hungry!

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.160
And...

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.400
What's your favorite?

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.720
It's you.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.240
I love tasting you.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.920
Come on.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.640
We're cooking here.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.240
Whenever you give me a smile,

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.320
you look really pretty.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.240
However, whenever you make a sad face...

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640
What?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440
You still look pretty

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.600
but in a different way!

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.440
You're gorgeous no matter what,

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.320
and that's because I really love you, Rin.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.600
You're my first love

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.120
and the only one I want.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.200
You crazy love-struck pup!

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.840
Want to try it?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.080
You really nailed it.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:00.960
Here.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.560
Feed me, please!

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.280
Let me have it, too.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.240
Good job, me!

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.320
Your cups of matcha are here!

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.560
Served with life and joy.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.280
Here. This one's for you, Balloon.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.720
And this one's for you, Jay.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.000
Thank you so much.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.880
You're always as lovely as ever.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.660
Come on.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.560
You've been very sweet to us

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.000
since you got back, haven't you?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.640
Of course, I have to!

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.440
I don't want to get fired again.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.580
By the way,

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.160
when are you getting married?

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.000
Don't forget to send me an invitation.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.730
I want to be your bridesmaid.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.320
Are you crazy? What are you saying?

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.920
We're just getting started.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400
That's right.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.720
That's way too soon.
Nobody gets married that quickly.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.500
We just started dating.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.920
It's too soon!

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.280
What about my relationship?

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.360
We got married even though
we hadn't dated each other.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.240
On top of that,
we didn't marry out of love.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.560
Now, we love each other, though.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.880
We really, really do.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.880
Sure, you love-struck girl.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480
So...

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.760
They say that couples eventually learn
to love each other after getting married.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.160
I guess this is what it's like.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880
It's true!

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.200
I can confidently say that
from my relationship.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.840
Drink up.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.120
They're really good.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.520
Thank you.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.280
Hong?

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.360
This way.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.600
Join us.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.120
- Come here!
- Aww!

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.680
Don't hide behind the silence.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.510
So good.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.700
Cheers!

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.880
Gosh, I can't take this anymore.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.760
You're madly love-struck.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.360
That's right.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.480
Very much so.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.600
You see, we didn't marry out of love.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.880
I can't help myself
now that we love each other!

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.920
I love her so much, Jay.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.880
Nothing we can do, alright?

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.160
I'm single, though.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.120
Hong?

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.200
Oh, dear.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.240
"It's too soon to get married, you know?"

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.480
Please give me a hug, too?

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.920
The matcha drink's really good.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.160
Please enjoy it a whole bunch.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.800
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.080
My dear wife!

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.010
- I'm here!
- I know!

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:32.920
Ow!

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.030
Hey!

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.800
Stop it, Khem.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.640
You're kissing me too much
that my cheeks are bruised.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.400
Well, I miss you.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.640
Now...

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.840
Do you remember

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.480
when I told you

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.720
there was something
I never wanted to tell anyone

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.640
but

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.920
you and you alone?

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.920
What is it?

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.040
[30/5/25: unread
2/7/25: unread]

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.280
[5/7/25: unread
7/7/25: unread]

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.520
[12/7/25: unread
15/7/25: unread]

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.560
She never read your messages?

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.520
Um...

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.600
I actually have two phones.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.040
I created that account on my other phone.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.800
What do you mean?

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.800
It means...

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.440
I didn't send those texts to Prapai.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.920
I sent it to myself

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.240
because

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.800
I couldn't share those feelings with her.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.240
Instead, I shared them with that account

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.240
so that it felt like

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.400
she was always there,
waiting to read them.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.840
Rin.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.760
From now on,
I'll be the one to hear your voice.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.320
I'm always here if you want to talk,

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.560
so feel free to tell me
whatever you're feeling, okay?

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.310
You no longer need to
embrace the emptiness in your heart.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.160
Thank you very much.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.800
But actually...

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.440
I no longer feel that way.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.040
I just want to tell you

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.640
before I delete that account.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.480
["Your birthday is coming up,
and I wish I could celebrate it with you..."]

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.320
That means...

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.160
I actually make you feel better, don't I?

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.400
Of course, you do.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360
I really have to thank you

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.440
for coming into my life.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.920
Ever since you came into my world,

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.460
I haven't had time
to think about trivial things

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.560
or miss my days with Prapai.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.680
Rin...

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.400
You've actually fallen for me, haven't you?

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520
Nonsense.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.320
Don't cry, my gorgeous.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.000
I love you, you know?

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.920
Or else you won't look pretty, you know?

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.640
Ow...

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.280
Oh, my goodness!

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.240
Oh, Rin...

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.680
It's my heart. My heart...

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.880
- What?
- Aww...

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.800
Why are you so sweet to me?

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.960
My heart can't take it anymore, Rin.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.640
Come on!

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.040
I just gave you a kiss.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.320
Why do you have to get this excited?

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.360
Please let me

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.840
kiss you back.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.770
- Stop it.
- Ow...

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.600
Listen.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.240
I called you here

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.760
because

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.560
I have something important to ask you.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.680
Ask away.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.800
I'm at your command.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Okay.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.880
Yes?

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.400
Let's make it official.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.760
Rin?!

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.160
Are you for real?

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.440
Yes.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.680
Let's register our marriage.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.840
This way, we'll officially
be a married couple,

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.360
specifically, a wife-and-wife couple

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.720
legally at last.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.240
And...

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.000
After that,

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.960
we'll raise our kids.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.760
Rin...

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.040
Do you want to have kids?

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.080
Mm.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680
Yes.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.660
Well...

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.680
I want to have kids

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.960
before I turn 40.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.920
Also, another thing I'll need is...

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.960
a lot of sleep.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.920
I need to raise kids,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.680
or else I won't be able
to take care of them.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.160
Taking care of you is already exhausting.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.240
And...

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.720
When are we going to register our marriage?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Today.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.150
What did you just say?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.040
- Today?
- Yes, today.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.680
We'll get it done right away.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.240
I've reached out to everybody.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.320
After having lunch,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.560
we'll get our marriage registered.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600
Okay?

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.800
I always thought that

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.960
love was nothing but a lie.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.600
It was just a relationship

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.800
that was meant to end.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.720
I used to love and get left behind.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.880
I was once blinded by the past.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.400
I refused to be loved

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.240
because I believed it didn't exist.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.640
I married her not because I loved her,

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.240
but out of obligation.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.720
I tried to make her go away

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.640
and deny any feelings I had for her.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.520
I was scared,

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.000
yet she was always there.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.120
No matter what,
she was always there for me.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.840
Then, one day,

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.120
I finally realized what true love means.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.680
Love is not only about giving

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.880
but also about receiving.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.040
It means allowing yourself to have feelings

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.160
and be willing to love someone

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.480
without fearing that
it will come to an end.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.080
I never knew

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.680
when I started falling for her.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.880
I just know that

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.120
if I lost her,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.880
I simply couldn't go on with my life.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.280
Now, I believe wholeheartedly
that love is real

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:31.000
because it makes me
want to spend the rest of my life with her.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.360
Yay! Rin!

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.680
We're about to make it official.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.360
Ms. Mai! Ms. Mai!

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.210
Ms. Mai!

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.640
I'm about to become Rin’s legal wife!

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.920
Keep it down!

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040
Let's get it done today.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.000
Are you ready?

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.460
Rin!

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.280
Having a younger partner

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.000
means you need a lot of energy
to keep up with them.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.640
My little pup is still enjoying life,

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.600
having fun as a young adult.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.760
For me, however,

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160
I don't find happiness in fancy things.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.880
Just seeing the person I love
flying high with happiness

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.960
is more than enough for me.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:08.240
