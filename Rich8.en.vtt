00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.667
Do you know who the culprit is?

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:53.967
Don't tell me...

00:16:53.967 --> 00:16:56.433
Was it the Leech?

00:17:05.433 --> 00:17:07.000
<i>Yesterday, Black Dog</i>

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.467
<i>sent me a text.</i>

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:13.400
<i>Be at the underground practice building by 9 pm.</i>

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:36.100
Ah, seriously!

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.167
What are you doing now?

00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:43.800
Does it make sense that you still
can't even track that bastard's outline?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.833
What about the police?

00:17:44.833 --> 00:17:48.100
They said tracking is difficult
because it's a foreign IP.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.600
Who doesn't know that?

00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:54.500
There's no time.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.333
If we can't catch them,

00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:58.900
then create something to solve it.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.400
Hey!

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.400
You crazy punk!

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.989
You got that video
from Park Woo Jin, right?

00:18:15.989 --> 00:18:18.233
Hand over Oh Si Eun's phone.

00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:20.300
Oh, who is this?

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.333
Aren't you Black Dog?

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:24.700
Black Dog?

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.967
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:18:25.967 --> 00:18:28.133
You would know better than me.

00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:30.200
The footage came out pretty clear.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.033
Should I show it?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.300
What is this?

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.000
Why would I be Black Dog?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.344
Even if you say it's not you,

00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:49.967
if I give this to Mr. Chairman,

00:18:49.967 --> 00:18:51.400
what do you think will happen?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.367
Black Dog summoned Park Woo Jin.

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:58.267
Black Dog appeared there.

00:18:58.267 --> 00:18:59.500
Enough.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.467
Where's Oh Si Eun's phone?

00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:04.000
Where did you hide Oh Si Eun's phone?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.367
Talk! I said talk!

00:19:06.367 --> 00:19:09.467
Where is it? I'm asking where it is!

00:19:09.467 --> 00:19:12.267
Have you thought about what to do from now on?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.567
Do I have to spell everything out for you?

00:19:22.133 --> 00:19:23.567
You...

00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:25.600
I'll expose everything.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.333
Then, you'll be done too.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.400
It's been spread around that
there's a murderer in Diamond 6.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.400
Do you think you'll be okay?

00:19:37.533 --> 00:19:40.733
Kim Hye In, you're surprisingly
stupider than I thought.

00:19:40.733 --> 00:19:42.733
That kind of thing can't send everyone away.

00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:45.267
Framing you would be easy.

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:47.300
So,

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:51.633
here.

00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:54.133
During Baek Jenna's engagement ceremony,

00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:58.500
testify that the murderer who
pushed Kim Hae In was Baek Jenna.

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:00.900
What did you say?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.600
Otherwise, I'll send your video to your dad

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.633
and the CCTV footage to Mr. Chairman.

00:20:06.633 --> 00:20:08.500
Pretty neat, huh?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.300
Well, in the end, both will
spread all over the world anyway.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:19.733
Snap out of it!

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:24.433
We don't have much time,
so you'd better decide quickly.

00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:30.333
This got dirty.

00:20:31.367 --> 00:20:33.967
If you want it, take it yourself.

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:50.733
Min Yul Hee

00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:53.867
has my video.

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:57.367
And the proof that I'm Black Dog.

00:20:58.367 --> 00:20:59.633
What?

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.533
What do you mean by that?

00:21:01.533 --> 00:21:05.100
The day we tried to summon Park Woo Jin,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.067
Min Yul Hee found out about
it and took the CCTV video.

00:21:10.067 --> 00:21:14.300
She said she'd take that to Mr. Chairman,

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.767
claiming that the Black Dog
Mr. Chairman is looking for

00:21:16.767 --> 00:21:18.833
is actually me.

00:21:19.933 --> 00:21:22.867
Why is everyone really acting like this?

00:21:22.867 --> 00:21:27.533
Min Yul Hee wants to drag Baek Jenna
down to hell until the end.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.167
The same goes for me.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Making a poor secretary
into a criminal with a record,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.600
you managed to escape somehow,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.733
Baek Jenna.

00:21:46.733 --> 00:21:49.100
It was Ha Min Hee's doing, not mine.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.267
And you too.

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:51.867
You're about to cause a big stir.

00:21:51.867 --> 00:21:53.300
Why are you dragging me into this?

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.600
You did it all.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.433
Me?

00:21:57.667 --> 00:22:00.133
I'm a very busy person.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.667
The fact that there's a murderer in Diamond 6

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:07.433
is already known by everyone.

00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:09.267
It must be unsettling.

00:22:09.267 --> 00:22:11.200
Min Yul Hee?

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.033
What?

00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:15.367
Am I the only one in Diamond 6?

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:18.567
And the person who hated Kim Hae In to death

00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:21.233
was you, not me.

00:22:26.233 --> 00:22:28.533
Why are you so desperate?

00:22:28.533 --> 00:22:31.033
The reason you became like this
is because of that trash Park Woo Jin.

00:22:31.033 --> 00:22:33.200
It wasn't because of me.

00:22:33.933 --> 00:22:36.333
You're the one...

00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:43.033
who is disgusting, Baek Jenna.

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:45.167
People tolerated you only
because you're part of Hanmyeong.

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:47.533
Do you think anyone actually
treated you as a person?

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:50.100
Behind your back, everyone insults and mocks you.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.033
I pitied your miserable life so much

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:56.367
that I endured everything while being your friend.

00:22:56.367 --> 00:22:59.167
But what did you do to me?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.000
You're truly pitiful.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.733
Everything you're doing,

00:23:05.733 --> 00:23:07.900
it's self-deprecation.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.133
Hey...

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:11.300
You're really done for now.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.833
I'll throw you into a pit
you can't escape from twice.

00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:16.633
Because I'll shove you in myself.

00:23:41.133 --> 00:23:42.900
[Min Yul Hee]
<i>Hurry up and decide.</i>

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.600
<i>Before I kill your father too.</i>

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.000
Min Yul Hee, you're insane!

00:24:08.633 --> 00:24:10.867
Why did you tell me?

00:24:16.233 --> 00:24:19.100
I know you're not on my side,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.933
but what's your goal?

00:24:22.467 --> 00:24:23.733
What if I know?

00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:26.400
I got fooled until now because I didn't know.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.600
But I won't be a stupid pawn
on your chessboard anymore.

00:24:32.233 --> 00:24:34.167
Jenna,

00:24:34.167 --> 00:24:36.933
don't make me...

00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:39.567
overturn the whole game because of you.

00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:20.667
I was worried,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.533
but nothing happened, right?

00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:28.100
Since when do you worry about me?

00:25:29.267 --> 00:25:30.733
Exactly.

00:25:30.733 --> 00:25:32.533
Hey,

00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:34.367
I was...

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.267
I was just...

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:41.067
Hey.

00:25:41.067 --> 00:25:43.100
What? What now?

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.900
Say something.

00:25:47.267 --> 00:25:48.867
I think...

00:25:48.867 --> 00:25:52.267
maybe staying in Diamond 6 isn't right.

00:25:53.067 --> 00:25:55.100
Suddenly?

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.767
I've cleared the suspicions

00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:03.267
and I can study on my own now.

00:26:03.267 --> 00:26:05.067
What?

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.900
I'll miss the bus.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.900
I'll go ahead.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.500
Hey!

00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:17.333
I'll take you home.

00:26:18.733 --> 00:26:20.933
No, it's fine.

00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:22.800
I'll get going now.

00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:28.467
What was that?

00:26:33.033 --> 00:26:35.767
[Do Un]

00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:40.000
<i>Hae In.</i>

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.900
Yeah?

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.967
<i>I'm thinking of studying abroad.</i>

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.933
- Abroad?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:26:46.933 --> 00:26:50.767
<i>I'm sick of this place.
I looked into some new schools.</i>

00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:52.567
<i>Do you want to go together?</i>

00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:55.533
- With you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:26:55.533 --> 00:26:58.300
<i>It's a boarding high school in Malaysia.
An international school.</i>

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.367
<i>Of course, it's nothing compared to here.</i>

00:27:00.367 --> 00:27:04.367
<i>But I think my mind would be very at ease.</i>

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.900
<i>Let's go together.</i>

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.067
You can become a scholarship student
recommended by our foundation.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.833
You tried to use me, right?

00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:21.200
Use me again.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.967
<i>This is a chance to escape from here.</i>

00:27:23.967 --> 00:27:26.533
Thanks, Do Un.

<i>Do I have to decide now?</i>

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.733
No.

00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:36.133
Then, shall we meet tomorrow and talk again?

00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:39.700
Yeah, let's do that.

00:27:41.267 --> 00:27:43.100
Okay.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.050
Hey, you wretch! Come with me.

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:07.000
My engagement with Min Yul Hee was canceled.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.733
Ah, you wretch!

00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:10.600
Did you get what you wanted?

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.033
What does that have to do with me?

00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:16.233
Why are you involved with me and causing this?
Darn it! What is going on?

00:28:16.233 --> 00:28:17.967
Move.

00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:19.867
Before I call the police.

00:28:19.867 --> 00:28:21.500
Call the police. Where's your phone?

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.000
Call them! Call the police, you wretch!

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.767
Do you think I'll listen to your crap?

00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:27.457
I'm the one who's messed up after
being involved with you!

00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:30.333
I'll report that I was recorded
and blackmailed, you wretch!

00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:32.133
What nonsense is this, seriously.

00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:33.816
Nonsense?

00:28:34.967 --> 00:28:37.500
But this slutty wretch, really...

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.567
What?

00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:41.214

Are you really going nuts because
I'm the one dealing with you?

Hey, I'll report you to the police.

00:29:11.033 --> 00:29:13.100
You wretch!

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.000
Get lost, you crazy wretch!

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.067
I'm sorry.

00:29:20.067 --> 00:29:21.900
I'm sorry.

00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:29.833
Darn it!

00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:31.000
I...

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.467
Because of you...

00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:36.233
Do you know what I've been through?

00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:50.265
Hey!

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.933
Look at yourself!

00:29:53.933 --> 00:29:57.167
You worthless shit. What you get for acting up!

00:29:57.167 --> 00:29:58.600
Hey.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.100
Live like this for the rest of your life, okay?

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.100
Do you understand?

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.267
Huh? You crazy girl.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.300
You're really such a dog-like slut.

00:30:56.633 --> 00:30:59.667
Hey, Kim Hae In!

00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:01.200
You...

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.500
Who hurt you like this?

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:10.033
Hey!

00:31:10.033 --> 00:31:14.767
Let me be honest with you,

00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:17.767
I want to end everything.

00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:19.767
But,

00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:22.167
Min Yul Hee

00:31:24.052 --> 00:31:25.985
and Park Woo Jin

00:31:26.804 --> 00:31:31.633
need to pay for their crimes.

00:31:31.633 --> 00:31:33.500
You...

00:31:34.333 --> 00:31:36.400
So,

00:31:37.233 --> 00:31:39.167
Hye In,

00:31:40.467 --> 00:31:42.567
just once,

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:45.333
please,

00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:47.492
help me.

00:31:47.492 --> 00:31:48.679
Please?

00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:51.333
The necklace

00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:54.367
is with you, right?

00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:58.433
Ah, that...

00:31:58.433 --> 00:32:02.667
You're the only witness.

00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:04.500
Huh?

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.305
Ah, that...

00:32:09.305 --> 00:32:11.172
Look.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.767
No, hey.

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:17.167
- No.
- Hye In,

00:32:17.167 --> 00:32:19.000
I won't do anything.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.533
Just help me this one time, really.

00:32:21.533 --> 00:32:22.667
I'm sorry.

00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:24.667
I'm really, really sorry.

00:32:24.667 --> 00:32:27.833
I was wrong all this time, I'm sorry.

00:32:27.833 --> 00:32:31.133
- I'm sorry.
- That's not it, Hae In.

00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:33.000
That...

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.567
That... the necklace

00:32:37.567 --> 00:32:39.867
is not with me.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.200
What?

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.967
That necklace

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:52.167
isn't with me.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.833
Then,

00:32:57.833 --> 00:33:00.333
have you been lying

00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:03.633
to me all this time?

00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:06.700
I...

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.433
trusted you

00:33:10.433 --> 00:33:12.833
all this time.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.333
I will

00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:19.800
try to find another way somehow, Hae In.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.733
I'm so sorry.

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:30.033
I tried to find a way too,

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:34.200
but now even my dad is in danger.

00:33:44.267 --> 00:33:46.100
Hae In.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.467
Right.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.067
I should've realized it back then.

00:33:55.067 --> 00:34:00.300
When I nearly fell off the rooftop
and died, you pretended not to know.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.333
I was out of my mind to trust you.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.767
Kim Hye In,

00:34:09.767 --> 00:34:13.167
you'll only speak the truth from now on.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.900
I hope you remember this

00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:21.000
for the rest of your life.

00:34:22.067 --> 00:34:23.346
What?

00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:28.967
Hae In.
