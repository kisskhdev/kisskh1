This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.360
A thousand seats with less than two weeks to go...

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.800
Do you think it’ll sell out?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.480
Honestly, we should’ve sold way more tickets by now.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.360
Do it, so we can sell more tickets.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.320
Oh!

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.200
What’s wrong with you?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.840
What are you even doing?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.400
Why can’t you control your emotions?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.120
Maybe it’s not just about the ticket sales anymore?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.920
Curious, aren’t you?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.440
And here they are! The lineup of fighters for this upcoming Hero Fight!

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.600
We’re finally getting to host the event!

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.040
Yay!

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.560
I will always be your real match.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
Can you watch camera B for me?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.600
We’ll be letting the audience into the arena in five minutes.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.800
Oh, okay.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.840
Also, can you play track one?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.680
We’ll bring the logo up right after.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.040
Test! One, two.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.800
One, two, three, four.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.600
One, two.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.800
One, two, three.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.240
One, two.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.200
I’m gonna go use the restroom real quick.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.800
Oh, sure.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.360
Let’s go.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Oh, Thun?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.040
I never thought this day would come.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.600
Me and boxing always seemed so far apart.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240
But look at me now.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.840
Yeah.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520
And now you even have a boxer for a boyfriend.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440
You’ve done such a great job, Keen.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.800
Getting this many people to show up.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.000
They’re all here to see you fight, Thun.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.480
Are you nervous at all?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.520
Nah, I’m good.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.480
Well...

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.760
Um...

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.240
You should head to the prep room, Thun.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.160
You’ve gotta get ready to fight.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.680
Yeah.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.160
Okay.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.760
I’m sorry for interrupting.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760
I didn’t realize someone was in here.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.320
Most of the rooms here are soundproof.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.160
I’ll excuse myself now.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
Okay.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760
Evidence

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.080
Greetings!

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.320
Woo!

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.560

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.040

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.240
The Hero Fight!

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.680
Woo!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.200
Good!

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.080
Block!

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.920
Come on, jabs.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.680
Ait!

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.400
Ait, get up.
Are you ok?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.520
Get up.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.280
Bung, get up.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.080
Quick, Bung.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.800
Bung! Go hard!

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.000
Are you ok?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.760
Calm down, Ait.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.120
Quickly, get the chair up.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Sit down.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.440
Ait, are you ok?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.720
Bung, get up.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.000
Just a bit more.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Ait? Can you hear me?

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.600
I'm cheering you on.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.080
Get up.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.640
Round Two, mentors out.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.520
Hey, fight on!
Come on, fight!

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.680
Hang in there, Ait. Stay strong.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.440
Ait…

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200
I love you, Ait.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.520
Let’s go, Bung!

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.560
Bung, you got this!

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.840
Come on!

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.400
Hurry, mentors out.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.880
Fighters in!

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.600
Go, Ait!

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.360
Fight, fight!

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.080
Let’s go!

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.800
Fight!

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.320
Punch him!

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.800
Yeah, like that!

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.040
Push in!

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.440
Yeah!!

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.360
Great job, Bung!

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.280
Well done, Ait!

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.040
Your fighters are all amazing.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.080
Thank you.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.560
Camera B, get a shot of the red corner, please.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.160
Okay.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Tighten up on camera B.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.800
Okay, switch that feed, please.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.880
Sure.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.720
Uh, can I borrow the schedule for a second?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.920
Oh, of course.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.600
Come on.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.840
Yep, right here.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.160
Woo, let’s go!

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.880
This camera, please?

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.560
This too.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.280
One more shot, please.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.480
Nice, push in a bit.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.240
Good, good.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.800
Smile for the camera!

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.400
Don’t just smile for Keen, okay?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.440
Quick!

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.040
This way!

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.440
Yes.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.600
Blue corner, blue corner!
Red corner!

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.120
Ait!
Red!

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:14.680
Red!

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.560
Blue!

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.880
Yeah!

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.160
Well done!

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
So proud of you!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.200
Congratulations, Ait! You did great.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.320
Thank you.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.400
Thank you, Coach.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.440
Ait, someone’s calling you.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.760
They said it’s urgent.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.200
You better pick up now!

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.280
What?!

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.280
Ait?!

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.720
Who was that?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.800
Hey!

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.560
Why are you here?

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.240
Skipped work?

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.920
I got suspended from the station,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.760
so I’ve got a little time off.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.800
What trouble did you get into this time?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.440
The case about that loan shark Muay

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.480
who got mauled to death by a big dog.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.000
Mauled by a dog?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Yeah.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.600
Doesn’t it seem kinda weird?

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.360
Get ready you’re up in five minutes.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.120
You can take him, no need to be scared or rattled.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.000
Stay calm when you fight, okay?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Yes, Coach.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.080
In the first round, just feel him out. Don’t rush it.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.000
Ready?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.960
Let’s go.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.680
And now, ladies and gentlemen, introducing first

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.960
Fighting in the red corner

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.840
He is a rescue hero and a fierce fighter.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.080
Let’s give it up for…

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.760
Lord of the Martial World

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.920
Woooo!

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.720
And he is opponent fighting in the blue corner.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.840
He is a handsome hero and a fan favorite known as..

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:07.080
The Heartless Left Hook!

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.680
Representing Petchsak Academy—

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:16.520
Please welcome… THUN, TIGER TAMING CANON!

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.520
Woooo!

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.560
Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to Hero Fight!

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.520
We’re here for the final match of the night,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.400
a historic bout between Thun, the Tiger Taming Canon,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.400
and Lord of the Martial World

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.800
Here we are for the round number one of action.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.400
Thun, the Tiger Taming Canon!

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.640
Woooo!

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.880
Taking on the strongest,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.080
Lord of the Martial World

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.280
Round One!

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.760
Let’s go, Thun! Go!

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.080
I remember Thun’s last match vividly.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.400
His form was top-notch.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.920
Don’t forget your guard!

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.720
Charge in, Thun!

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.520
Go, Thun!

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.600
Come on, throw the right!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.480
Keep your guard up!

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.120
Use your legs too!

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.720
Use your legs!

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.640
Why does Thun look off?

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.360
Why is he fighting like that?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.600
I have no idea.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.960
What's wrong with him?

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.080
Right?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.040
Keep your guard up!

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.040
That’s it, son, good!
Hit him! Hit him!

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.280
Don’t drop your guard!

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.840
Yut’s punches are seriously heavy.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.160
Looks like the Cannon might not make it through this.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.000
With that kind of form, Thun can still hold his own.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.280
Hey! Thun!

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.200
Thun!!

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.600
Thun, get up!

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.320
Thun!

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.680
Can you hear me?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.200
Thun, get up!!

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.640
Get up, Thun! Hurry!

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.280
Thun!

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.840
Come on!

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.000
Fight!

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.280
Thun!!

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.880
Thun!

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.080
Call the medic now, please.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.600
Yes, sir.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.960
Thun!

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.040
Thun, are you okay?!

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.280
Thun!
Thun, get up!

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.560
Can you hear me?!

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.760
Thun! Get up!
What’s wrong with him?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.960
Thun!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.880
One… two… three…

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.120
Four… five… six…

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.280
Thun!!

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.240
Seven…
Thun!!

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.760
Thun!

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.280
Eight!

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.480
Medic!!

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.200
What the hell happened?

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.560
Damn it. How did he get knocked out like that?

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.200
Thun!

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200
Thun!

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.840
Thun!

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.320
Thun!

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.400
Can you hear me?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.920
Hurry, medics!

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.160
Watch his head!

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.160
Thun.
Focus, stay with us!

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.200
Watch his head!

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.840
Get him out.
You’re okay.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.680
Thun!

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.200
What happened?

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.200
Hey, was he drugged or something?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.520
Probably.
Sounds like it.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.960
What the hell…

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.560
Who organized this event?!
He was drugged, right?!

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.560
Come out and take responsibility!

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.680
Fucking hell.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.080
Just moments ago,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.480
a well-known boxer known as Tiger Taming Cannon

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.000
or Thun Sukkasem,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.360
collapsed in the ring only minutes into the match.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.560
There’s speculation that he may have been drugged with a diuretic.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.360
We will keep updating you as the situation develops.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.680
What kind of damn event is this? A boxer got drugged!
Who’s taking responsibility for this?!

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.880
Who even organized this thing?!

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.200
Shut it down.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.880
Shut it all down!

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.920
With things like this, it’s doomed to fail.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.080
Phuwish.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.760
Keen, how are things?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.040
Thun’s safe now.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.920
But I really have to apologize for the negligence.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.320
Though I assure you, my team checked every single bottle of water.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.840
Alright, I'm having the police are looking into it now.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.800
I truly am sorry.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.000
Hello.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.920
Hey there.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.120
Don’t beat yourself up over it, Keen.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.120
Don’t beat yourself up over it, Keen.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.240
I haven’t seen something like this in over ten years.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.840
Good thing Thun’s in such good shape.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.840
That’s why he’s not seriously hurt.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.240
Still it really was my fault.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.160
If I hadn’t slipped up, Thun wouldn’t have..

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.680
Don’t overthink it.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.480
You did your best.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.720
Then I’ll stay and look after Thun tonight.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.280
Good, but don’t forget to rest yourself, alright?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.280
We can’t have you falling too.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.160
Yes, sir.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.840
I’ll be heading off then.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.520
Take care, Coach.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.760
Thun!

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.400
Ow!

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.000
Sorry, did that hurt?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.280
Where does it hurt?

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.320
Does it hurt a lot?

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.640
Are you messing with me?

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.800
Do you know how worried I've been?

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.000
Aww, I’m sorry…

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I’m all better now.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.600
You like teasing, huh?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.200
So…

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.200
How’s work going?

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.040
Worry about yourself first.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.400
Do you even realize you were drugged with a diuretic, Thun?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.880
They still haven’t found who did it.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.440
I’m sorr-

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.120
I knew you were going to say that.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.400
You didn’t do anything wrong, Keen.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.640
What happened to your hand?

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.640
Paper cut.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.680
Does it hurt?

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.080
It doesn’t anymore.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.080
(Petchsak Academy Gym)

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.640
Many believe the boxer being drugged this time

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.040
was part of a scheme to discredit MP Phuwish, orchestrated by the top promoter,

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.520
Pakorn, who's likely unhappy with recent Muay Thai reform policies.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.760
This act may have sealed the coffin

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.560
for the rising new promoter from Petchsak Academy.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.920
“For what I’ve said on the ring”

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.440
“If that’s made you uncomfortable”

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.760
“I’m really sorry.”

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200
I love you, Ait.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.560
“Where are you?”

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.720
What happened was something no one wanted.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.080
Our Tiger Taming Cannon is now recovering,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.640
and there’s nothing to worry about.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.640
So… let us ask you this

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.080
how do you feel about the event being a bit of a flop?

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.960
Well, no one’s happy about it.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.520
And no one wanted it to go this way.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.760
But I believe people make mistakes.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.480
That said, I want to commend promoter Keen.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.880
He really modernized this event

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.440
and helped it reach a broader audience.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.960
Will we get to see Yut fight again?

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.000
As for the damages,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.320
we’re working hard to fix everything.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.040
Don’t believe them!

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.680
We’ve refunded some of the audience...

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.360
These bastards are cheating us!
Hey!

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.960
Let me go, damn it!

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.000
These fuckers are screwing over the people!

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.960
Let go of me!

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.160
I said LET GO!
Why are they doing this?!

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.360
Let me go!

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.280
Hey, let go!

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.120
Let go!

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.760
Do you believe him?

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.800
You really trust him, huh?!

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.680
He is corrupted!

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.960
LET GO!

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.400
LET ME GO!

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.000
Let him go.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.760
He’s a victim.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.680
Let him go.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.800
I must apologize to you.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.200
I’m truly sorry for the mismanagement of this event.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.960
And I promise you that

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.360
next time, it won’t be like this.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.720
I’m sorry.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.440
Please let him go.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.840
It’s okay.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.560
You can actually eat by yourself, no?

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.720
I know.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.720
But I want you to feed me.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.360
Okay.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.360
You want me to feed you?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.360
Keen!

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.360
You want me to feed you~

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.640
Keen…

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Is there anything you want to say?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.200
They totally scammed everyone!
We’ve refunded some of the audience...

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.480
Hey!

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.160
Let go!

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.040
These fuckers are screwing over the people!

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.240
Let go!

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.880
I said let go!
Why are they doing this?!

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.480
Let him go.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.000
He’s a victim.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.440
I truly apologize.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.160
And I promise you,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.080
it won’t happen again.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Excuse me,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.640
I need to check the patient’s blood pressure.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.320
Alright.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.160
Thun, I’ll let you eat by yourself now.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:42.840
What?

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.480
I’m gonna take a shower and buy you some snacks.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.480
Okay.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.840
Alright, be back soon.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.600
Follow me, it’s a bit messy down the way.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.240
Right here, this is where it happened.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.520
I really needed to pee,

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.960
so I stopped by to relieve myself.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.280
And ended up stumbling across a corpse.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.640
Still gives me chills just talking about it.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.080
It's still vivid in my mind.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:35.840
June 21, 2025, 10:05 AM.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.040
This is the crime scene where Muay's body was found.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.800
She was mauled to death by a large dog,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.080
was found near Saeree Rak Market.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.480
The crime scene is clean,

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.000
no indication of dog footprints or any signs of a dog had been here,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.400
like feces or fur.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.120
All is found were bloodstains and tire tracks near the body.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.520
To be honest

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.760
it’s hard to believe a dog around here could kill someone.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.160
Oh? Back already, Keen?

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.640
Uncle, may I borrow a broom?

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.720
What are you doing here?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.400
Oh, Keen?

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.200
Oh?

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.880
Well, we meet again.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.440
Hello.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.800
Hi.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.320
I’m sorry.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.960
Sorry for what?

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.400
For causing you trouble.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.800
Oh, no worries at all, Keen.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.240
It was nothing.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.680
So, how’s Thun doing?

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.600
He’s getting better.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.480
The doctor said he can be discharged once the IV fluids are done.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.760
That’s good to hear.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.400
Here, take this.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:33.960
Let me.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.040
I'll go myself.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.280
Are you sure?

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.080
It’s fine.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.080
Alright.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.040
(Victory always comes with wounds.)

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.040
(Everything...)

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.240
Please.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.640
Go ahead.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.080
Hello?

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.440
I think Muay’s death and your father’s

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.640
might’ve been a murde-

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.040
Hello?

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.320
What did you just say?

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.440
I’ve got bad signal.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.560
Hello?

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.840
Hello?

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.800
Hey?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.920
What did you say?

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.680
Keen...

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.120
Hello?

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.760
Sorry...

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.200
Hello??

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.960
I can’t hear..

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.000
Hello?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.200
Can you hear me?

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.280
Yeah, I just got out of the elevator.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.760
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.120
I hear you now.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.640
So, I came to check out the scene where Muay’s body was found.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.360
And honestly, this case is starting

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.200
to feel a lot like your father’s.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.720
What do you mean?

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:48.200
I think Muay and your father

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.960
were killed by the same person.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.760
(And based on the evidence I have right now...)

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.320
About the score tampering...

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.040
It was you this time too, wasn’t it?

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.480
You think I drugged you?

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.920
(I think that...)
You don’t know anything.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.200
But you’re still my son!

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.680
Pakorn is the murderer.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.400
What happened here?

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.680
Why is this room trashed like this?

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.960
Ait’s gone.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.960
Did Ait do this?

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.320
If you don’t want to die, stay put!!

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.560
You don’t have to answer right away.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.120
Talk it over first.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.720
I know who drugged Thun.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.360
Have you seen this pin before?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.000
Looks like it belongs to some secret organization.
