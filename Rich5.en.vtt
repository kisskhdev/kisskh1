[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.633
Let me introduce you

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:53.633
my fiancé,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.266
Cha Jin Wook.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.533
That's right.

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.633
We're engaged.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.200
Don't be mistaken.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.233
What, Baek Jenna?

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.300
You put the Equal Opportunity Leech in Diamond 6,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.500
and now you're even engaged
to an illegitimate child?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.033
How did you end up like this, Baek Jenna?

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.633
I don't think this is the time
for you to worry about me.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.333
But, Yul Hee,

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.266
you need to develop better taste.

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.200
Your eye for dresses is really

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:48.000
quite poor.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.866
Hey, don't take pictures!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.366
I told you to stop!

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:25.633
Hey!

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:28.900
You humiliate me like this
and think you can just leave?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.833
You crazy girl!

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.233
This is your place now,

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:40.033
Min Yul Hee.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.633
This...

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:43.700
Let go.!

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.000
Hey, Baek Jenna.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.700
Hey!

00:02:58.066 --> 00:02:59.900
You!

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:01.800
Hey!

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.200
Why do you keep showing up everywhere

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.133
to ruin my life?

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:08.166
Did you feel good wearing that
pretty dress? Did you have fun?

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.366
Enjoyed playing dress-up?

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:10.933
- Take this off!
- Yul Hee!

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:13.066
How dare you touch someone like her!

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.833
Yeah, this is better.

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:26.033
How is it?

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.800
Do you like it?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.033
This is what you should wear.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:30.733
Who do you think you are to wear such clothes?

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:33.233
Doesn't this look more like you?

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:35.833
What?

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:38.966
What?

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:43.733
You crazy bitch!

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.100
This insane scum!

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.100
Hye In!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.833
Hye In!

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:38.400
Please, don't follow me.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.533
I'm begging you.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:42.266
I won't follow you, just wear this and leave.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.933
On that day, I came to realize

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:01.266
that to Baek Jenna,

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:04.300
I was nothing more than a tool.

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:07.533
Like a piece on a chessboard,

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:10.500
being to be used only when needed

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.866
and then discarded.

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:24.333
Was today's incident all planned?

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.833
What sudden change of heart is this?

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:28.766
You're right.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:31.200
Since I stand on the chessboard,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.833
I must place my own pieces.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.100
Clever of you.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.000
I have no intention of losing my spot

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.700
as the heir to Hanmyeong Group

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.066
or my position as queen of the Diamond 6.

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:41.666
You'll probably

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:44.800
beat your elder brothers
and become the heir yourself.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.800
You know everything.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.666
But for some reason,

00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:53.566
I feel like that's not the whole story.

00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:56.266
The Cha Jin Wook I've observed these days

00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:59.100
doesn't seem interested
in things like being the heir.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.766
What is

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:07.000
your real motive?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.066
There's none.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.533
I'm just an ordinary person

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:19.533
striving to achieve what I want.

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:22.833
You? Ordinary?

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.533
Anyway,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.500
let's cooperate

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.366
until we no longer need each other.

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.400
Fine, let's do that.

[Cheongdam International High School]

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:01.300
What?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.600
[Cheongdam High's Min Yul Hee
got covered in dirt and humiliated]

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.466
Crazy!

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:11.733
She's insane.

[Cha Jin Wook, third son of Chasel Medic, engaged
to Hanmyeong Group's daughter Baek Jenna]

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:20.333
Cha Jin Wook's truly legendary.

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:21.400
With Baek Jenna?

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.533
[If Cha Jin Wook becomes engaged to Baek Jenna,

[Min Yul Hee]

00:07:50.566 --> 00:07:53.166
She needs to know her place.

00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:55.900
Where is that Leech going?

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.200
Learn where you belong.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.733
Looking forward to it.

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:06.600
After Baek Jenna, you're next.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.333
You never drank decaf before.

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:17.800
Oh, really?

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.366
I was told to be careful with caffeine,

00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:27.266
Do Un,

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:31.000
can't I visit the Diamond 6 Lounge?

00:08:33.233 --> 00:08:34.766
Not just anyone can go in there.

00:08:34.766 --> 00:08:36.633
Besides...

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:43.700
I'm not in the Diamond 6 anymore.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.900
Really?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.133
But none of that matters now.

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:50.733
I like being here with you more.

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:52.666
Since when?

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:55.333
Why are you only telling me now?

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:56.633
No, it's just...

00:08:56.633 --> 00:08:58.300
it's not a big deal.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.866
This isn't 'a big deal'?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.766
A few days ago, Park Woo Jin...

00:09:08.566 --> 00:09:09.633
Park Woo Jin?

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:11.500
Do you know him?

00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:14.200
You don't, right?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.000
When did you guys talk?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.366
Is that what's important right now?

00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:19.766
Then what's important? Huh?

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:22.533
Ah, then what's important?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.500
Hye In, did you get home safely yesterday?

00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:45.900
Seriously. Why are people so mean?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.000
Let's stop talking about that.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.833
Okay.

00:09:50.766 --> 00:09:51.866
But,

00:09:51.866 --> 00:09:55.300
Cha Jin Wook and Baek Jenna's
engagement is causing a stir.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.800
They said they had a formal family meeting
as soon as he returned to Korea.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.033
Did you know? About Baek Jenna
and Cha Jin Wook's engagement?

00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:04.366
Of course.

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:06.833
There's nothing I don't know.

00:10:07.733 --> 00:10:09.733
Then, do you

00:10:09.733 --> 00:10:11.800
know Oh Si Eun too?

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:13.966
Oh Si Eun?

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:14.966
Of course.

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:17.800
You know, JLK's granddaughter who had an accident.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.366
Accident?

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:20.900
It was a suicide.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.000
Why do you call it an accident?

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:26.266
Ah, right.

00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:28.666
Ah, I got confused.

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:30.066
Then, do you

00:10:30.066 --> 00:10:34.200
know Oh Si Eun's phone disappeared too?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.733
Phone?

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:37.633
Why does that matter?

00:10:39.366 --> 00:10:41.833
Are you hiding something from me?

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.666
No.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.333
What's wrong with you?

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:48.766
I knew this would happen.

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:52.366
What is it? Why have you been acting
this way towards me all this time?

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.133
Well, it's just...

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:08.166
I want to see you more often.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:09.966
Huh?

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:12.533
Ah...

00:11:12.533 --> 00:11:15.200
I really didn't want to say this.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.200
Oh! My favorite sausage.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.200
Hm, delicious.

00:11:27.633 --> 00:11:30.666
Excuse me.

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:39.866
I just like spicy pork.

00:11:42.266 --> 00:11:44.166
Why aren't you eating?

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:48.566
You have an appetite right now?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.700
You're leaving this?

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:40.166
It's been a while, Ms. Ha Min Hee.

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.600
No.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.100
Hanmyeong Group Madam?

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:51.333
It's been a while, Yul Hee.

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:53.000
Since you're welcoming me like this,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.333
I think it was good to reach out.

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:58.400
I've heard about you often.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.733
Did the rumor that I want to crush Baek Jenna

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:06.400
reach all the way over there?

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.333
You could say that.

00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:10.566
That's why I'm here.

00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:16.800
I think I could

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.333
be quite helpful to you.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.366
The same

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.233
goes for me.

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:44.466
Mind if I sit for a moment?

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:47.066
Sorry,

00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:48.933
but I'm not leaving this school.

00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:49.966
Hey...

00:13:49.966 --> 00:13:53.100
Let's pretend that never happened.

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:57.100
Can we talk for a minute?

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.000
Do you know why Seo Do Un was kicked out?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.466
Baek Jenna kicked out Seo Do Un

00:14:06.466 --> 00:14:08.900
to stick Kim Hye In in his place.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.866
Her friend of 18 years.

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:13.333
While you were hovering between
life and death in the hospital,

00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:15.433
you know how Kim Hye In

00:14:15.433 --> 00:14:17.933
got in here, right?

00:14:17.933 --> 00:14:18.766
So?

00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:20.300
Between Kim Hye In

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.300
and me,

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.800
who's more horrifying?

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.766
You know what they say, the enemy of my enemy

00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:34.600
can be my friend.

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:41.500
We'll get

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.466
very close soon.

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:17.166
[Hanmyeong Group's next generation]

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:29.633
Turn around.

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:32.266
Yes.

00:15:45.133 --> 00:15:46.233
Lee Sa Rang,

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:48.966
I know you have Oh Si Eun's phone.

00:15:48.966 --> 00:15:51.633
If you don't want it exposed, come here.

00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:53.066
- Saturday night at 11.
- What's so serious?

00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:55.833
Ah, you startled me!

00:15:55.833 --> 00:15:57.666
Oh!

00:15:58.433 --> 00:15:59.633
Oh my, who is this?

00:15:59.633 --> 00:16:01.233
The heir of Hanmyeong Group

00:16:01.233 --> 00:16:03.933
has come to such a humble place.

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:08.166
Why are you here?

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.333
It may be humble, but have a seat.

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:12.466
You go sit, too.

00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:14.333
Sun Joo...

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.400
Wow, it's the same uniform,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.033
but this one is just gleaming. It's shining.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.300
I'll give you a drink on the house.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.133
We have malt whisky here.

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:28.533
How about it, a strong glass?

00:16:28.533 --> 00:16:30.066
Just give me a coffee.

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:32.866
Oh, coffee.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:35.266
When it comes to coffee, that's me.

00:16:35.266 --> 00:16:37.766
I won first place
at the international barista competition

00:16:37.766 --> 00:16:38.800
this year...

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.700
Sun Joo,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.000
stop it.

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:51.300
You live such an easy life.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.833
I guess making a fool out of
someone is nothing to you.

00:16:54.833 --> 00:16:56.566
If this is about the party yesterday,

00:16:56.566 --> 00:16:58.366
I thought you'd be thanking me.

00:16:58.366 --> 00:16:59.033
What?

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:01.133
I put you on the same level as Min Yul Hee.

00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:02.766
In front of everyone.

00:17:02.766 --> 00:17:05.400
Hey, are you crazy?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.266
I never wanted that. What kind of...

00:17:07.266 --> 00:17:10.066
It was your choice to wear that dress.

00:17:10.066 --> 00:17:12.666
I may have given you the dress

00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.400
and a spot in the Diamond 6,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.366
but it's up to you to live up to that level.

00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:21.733
Since you've made a move for me on my chessboard,

00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:24.833
I'll grant you a favor later.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.300
This is the material for tomorrow's interview.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.533
Do it well.

00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:32.433
I don't need it, so take it back.

00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:34.333
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:36.633
But the scholarship foundation
won't just stand by.

00:17:36.633 --> 00:17:38.066
In the worst-case scenario,

00:17:38.066 --> 00:17:40.400
it could be revoked.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.633
Hello.

00:17:59.633 --> 00:18:03.100
I am Kim Hye In, a sophomore
at Cheongdam International High School,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.100
selected as a scholarship recipient
by the Hanmyeong Scholarship Foundation.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.566
First, I would like to express my gratitude

00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:11.000
to Chairman Baek Joo Won

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.566
and many officials

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:15.700
who gave me the opportunity to have this interview

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.533
in such a joyous and proud setting.

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:22.533
Furthermore, I would like to once
again express my deep gratitude

00:18:22.533 --> 00:18:23.866
for giving students like me,

00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:27.500
who entered through the equal
opportunity program, the hope and opportunity

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.100
to become a member of Hanmyeong if we work hard.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.266
Thank you.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.666
No CCTV, perfect.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.966
Perfect timing.

00:18:47.966 --> 00:18:49.800
How dare you humiliate me like that!

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.800
Where does a Leech think she's going,
acting all high and mighty?

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.133
You are a Diamond 6?

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.333
What the heck?

00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:57.333
Darn it!

00:18:57.333 --> 00:19:00.766
Darn it! Seriously!

00:19:00.766 --> 00:19:03.300
Hey, does it hurt?

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:05.933
Does it hurt a lot?

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.333
You didn't know?

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:14.000
Life is pain, you scum.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.566
Watch your back at night.

00:19:33.066 --> 00:19:34.700
What?

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.966
There you are.

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:38.133
You did well in the interview.

00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:40.900
Hey!

00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:43.600
Hey!

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.466
What?

00:19:45.466 --> 00:19:47.800
Your interview during the day went well.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.066
Hey, has the issue with that pervert's video

00:19:54.066 --> 00:19:55.933
been resolved?

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:00.500
What is this?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.100
Do you

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.766
happen to know anything

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:12.233
about Lee Sa Rang?

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:14.066
Lee Sa Rang?

00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:15.900
Why?

00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:20.066
You've been hanging around together lately.

00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:21.200
Could it be...

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.966
Could it be, what?

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:25.533
Hey, snap out of it.

00:20:25.533 --> 00:20:27.900
He's the same as the others.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.800
Just like when Seo Do Un met Kim Hae In.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.200
Like some kind of

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.300
decorative item?

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.800
No, that's not it.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.300
A little while ago,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.100
I saw Oh Si Eun's phone

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.366
in Lee Sa Rang's bag.

00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:52.400
Oh Si Eun's phone?

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:09.166
Can I call you Jin Wook?

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:12.000
Yes, Mother.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.166
Already calling me Mother?

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:16.333
I'm in a good mood.

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:21.333
Jenna is getting along well
with Jin Wook too. I'm relieved.

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:24.866
We are getting along much better than you thought.

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.200
Your father seems busy lately.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.766
Do you meet often?

00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:31.633
Yes, I see him and greet him every day.

00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:35.233
It couldn't have been easy
to secure the management shares.

00:21:35.933 --> 00:21:37.133
Yes.

00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:38.366
So, about that,

00:21:38.366 --> 00:21:40.133
Jenna and Hanmyeong Group

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.033
will become a great source of strength for you.

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:43.400
Jin Wook, you too

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.600
should become an asset to Jenna and Hanmyeong.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.400
Yes.

00:21:54.966 --> 00:21:58.666
I should also meet Jin Wook's
mother and pay my respects.

00:21:58.666 --> 00:22:01.933
She'll soon become Jenna's mother-in-law,

00:22:01.933 --> 00:22:03.466
isn't that right, Chairman?

00:22:03.466 --> 00:22:06.066
Yes, arrange it when there's an opportunity.

00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:09.400
My mother will return to Korea soon.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.266
As soon as she returns,

00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:12.466
I'll set up a meeting.

00:22:12.466 --> 00:22:13.800
Great.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.266
I look forward to meeting her soon.

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:17.966
She raised her son exceptionally well.

00:22:17.966 --> 00:22:19.466
If our son

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:24.200
grows up as fine as Jin Wook,
I'll have no regrets.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.800
Thank you for saying that.

00:22:33.233 --> 00:22:35.066
Well then,

00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.333
you two stay a bit longer.

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:39.566
I have a business trip tomorrow
morning, so I'll get going.

00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:41.433
Let's meet again in a nice setting next time.

00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:43.666
Yes, please get home safely.

00:22:43.666 --> 00:22:45.466
Let's go.

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:49.200
Jenna.

00:22:57.933 --> 00:22:59.633
What's wrong?

00:22:59.633 --> 00:23:01.533
Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

00:23:01.533 --> 00:23:03.500
I'll leave too.

00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:07.300
Did I do something wrong again?

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.066
Let go.

00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:10.733
If something bothers you, say it.

00:23:13.533 --> 00:23:14.533
Don't tell me

00:23:14.533 --> 00:23:16.800
it's because of what she said,
about hoping your brother

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.933
would be like me.

00:23:17.933 --> 00:23:19.900
Who is my brother?

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.233
That illegitimate child?

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.533
Why?

00:23:26.533 --> 00:23:29.366
Does seeing me make you feel
like crap because it's like looking

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:30.366
at your brother's future?

00:23:30.366 --> 00:23:34.300
I find his very existence horrifying.

00:24:09.733 --> 00:24:12.666
[Father]

00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:17.033
Yes, Father.

00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:21.033
Chairman Baek seems to like you a lot.

00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:26.333
For them to bring up the engagement first,

00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:29.466
our Jin Wook is truly outstanding.

00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:33.533
As expected, you're different from
your brothers, right down to your genes.

00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:35.700
Yes, Father.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.533
I'll make sure not to disappoint you.

00:24:37.533 --> 00:24:41.400
Once we are tied to Hanmyeong through marriage,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.400
we begin the operation.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.233
Hanmyeong will be ours now too.

00:24:46.233 --> 00:24:48.566
Make absolutely no mistakes.

00:24:48.566 --> 00:24:50.800
Of course.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.666
Yes, get some rest.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.533
How is the acquisition of the
Hanmyeong Holdings shares going?

00:25:04.533 --> 00:25:06.000
It has been proceeding smoothly

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.933
since the engagement announcement.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.766
Oh.

00:25:13.066 --> 00:25:15.533
Handle it without any problems.

00:25:16.866 --> 00:25:19.766
[List of Major Shareholders
and Share Transfer Signatures]

00:25:19.766 --> 00:25:23.500
What are your plans for Jin Wook?

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.600
That bastard?

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.400
Once we secure Hanmyeong Group's shares,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.700
get rid of him discreetly.

00:25:31.433 --> 00:25:33.466
Understood.

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:44.600
It's late, Hye In.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.566
Are you eating ramen again?

00:25:49.666 --> 00:25:53.533
Ramen is surprisingly healthy.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.000
You're

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.733
having dinner properly, right?

00:25:59.533 --> 00:26:01.200
Of course.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.133
I eat well at the lounge.

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:11.866
I brought this from the lounge.

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:14.566
Eat it while you work.

00:26:14.566 --> 00:26:16.366
This...

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.000
Is it okay to just take these?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.866
Sure.

00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:25.766
Dad.

00:26:25.766 --> 00:26:28.066
Yes, what is it?

00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:30.933
I'll do well.

00:26:30.933 --> 00:26:35.266
I know you'll do well.

00:26:35.266 --> 00:26:37.100
You're already doing great.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.700
Don't worry.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.166
Go check your room.

00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:43.566
I left a gift.

00:26:43.566 --> 00:26:46.333
- A gift?
- Yes.

00:27:06.366 --> 00:27:09.333
I will always believe in you.

00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:11.433
Everything will be okay.

00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:13.666
I love you, our daughter.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.433
[Hanmyeong Hospital]

00:27:32.566 --> 00:27:35.266
I was wondering whom Jenna got her beauty from.

00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:38.133
As expected, she takes after her mother.

00:27:39.433 --> 00:27:41.900
Actually, I do hear that quite a bit.

00:27:44.766 --> 00:27:45.833
What's up with you?

00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:48.266
Oh, Jenna!

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:50.466
You should've introduced us earlier.

00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:52.433
I came to pay my respects.

00:27:52.433 --> 00:27:56.033
Jin Wook is so admirable.

00:27:56.733 --> 00:27:58.000
Did you know that?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.466
Someone was sending me flowers
every single day, so I thought it was you.

00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:04.100
But it turned out to be him.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.000
When you get older, things like this
are so heart-fluttering and nice.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.100
Mother,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.033
I'll make sure you get flowers every single day.

00:28:12.033 --> 00:28:14.000
- Really?
- Yes.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.033
So you can always feel that flutter.

00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:20.100
Then, I'd be very grateful.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.866
How did you know which hospital my mom was in?

00:28:30.866 --> 00:28:32.466
You can't survive next to Baek Jenna

00:28:32.466 --> 00:28:34.400
without at least that level
of information gathering.

00:28:35.933 --> 00:28:38.100
My mom really likes it.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.800
It's been a while since
I've seen her smile like that.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.166
It's the first time I've
seen you smile like that, too.

00:28:46.733 --> 00:28:49.933
I'm sorry about that day.

00:28:57.866 --> 00:28:59.766
Mom.

00:28:59.766 --> 00:29:01.466
I'm sorry.

00:29:01.466 --> 00:29:03.200
It's okay.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.166
It's fine.

00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:08.633
Hyun Jin, I told you not
to run in places like this.

00:29:12.733 --> 00:29:14.766
It's the first time I've seen you smile like that.

00:29:14.766 --> 00:29:15.566
Me?

00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:18.966
Usually, when you smile, your eyes don't smile.

00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:21.000
But when you just smiled,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.033
your eyes smiled too.

00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:29.966
I learned that smiling is also a skill.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.933
Anyway, from what I can see,

00:29:33.933 --> 00:29:37.300
you don't look like you're
sincere with Chairman Cha.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.100
What is this?

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.900
Have you been staring at me every single day?

00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:47.566
What about your mom?

00:29:47.566 --> 00:29:49.600
Is she in Singapore?

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.400
My mom?

00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:57.633
My mom...

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.633
My mom passed away.

00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:05.866
Ah, sorry.

00:30:05.866 --> 00:30:07.833
I didn't know.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.333
I'm just kidding.

00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.666
She is in the US,

00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:17.366
living very comfortably.

00:30:17.366 --> 00:30:19.166
Really?

00:30:20.733 --> 00:30:24.666
You said earlier that you
have to prove your worth.

00:30:24.666 --> 00:30:27.733
As you know, I'm no different.

00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:30.533
I have to prove

00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:32.600
my worth too.

00:30:37.266 --> 00:30:39.933
It seems we both need each other.

00:30:42.466 --> 00:30:44.766
You crazy punk! Are you threatening me right now?

00:30:44.766 --> 00:30:47.500
Why are you so curious whether
the baby in my womb is a boy or a girl?

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.700
I'll just make him Chairman Baek's son!

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.966
The heir of Hanmyeong Group.

00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:56.533
In that sense,

00:30:56.533 --> 00:30:58.318
can I ask one favor?

00:30:58.318 --> 00:30:59.626
Yes.

00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:04.600
Can you connect me with

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.833
Chasel Medic hospital line?

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:10.100
It's not too difficult.

00:31:11.066 --> 00:31:15.500
Aren't you going to ask why?

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.300
No need.

00:31:19.266 --> 00:31:20.933
Is there really a need to ask?

00:31:20.933 --> 00:31:24.266
It's something Baek Jenna is doing.

00:31:24.266 --> 00:31:26.300
There must be a reason for it all.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.233
Student Kim Hae In?

00:31:43.233 --> 00:31:45.266
May I sit for a moment?

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.633
Yes.

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:56.600
I knew about you for a while,
but my greeting is late.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.100
I'm Director Seo Hee Kwon.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.300
Yes, I know.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.233
Any issues since returning to school?

00:32:04.233 --> 00:32:05.933
No.

00:32:05.933 --> 00:32:09.433
Everyone treats me well.

00:32:09.433 --> 00:32:11.533
Good. That's a relief.

00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:15.400
You came back after much difficulty,
so you must adapt well.

00:32:16.133 --> 00:32:17.933
Yes.

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:21.466
By any chance,

00:32:21.466 --> 00:32:23.866
if your memories return,

00:32:23.866 --> 00:32:26.466
make sure to tell me.

00:32:27.666 --> 00:32:30.900
I'm always available.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.733
Yes.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.100
Student Seo Do Un?

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.566
Do you have something to say?

00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:47.600
No, Director.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.533
But it's polite to greet an elder

00:32:53.533 --> 00:32:56.300
when you meet one.

00:33:07.933 --> 00:33:10.500
Let's talk for a minute.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.333
How long are you going to keep avoiding me?

00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:15.066
I was wrong back then. I'm sorry.

00:33:15.066 --> 00:33:17.066
You don't need to apologize.

00:33:17.066 --> 00:33:18.800
You don't have to.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.066
- I'll take you home later.
- No,

00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:23.333
you don't have to.

00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:25.766
I don't have time for useless
things like this anymore.

00:33:25.766 --> 00:33:26.900
Hae In, what are you talking about?

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.900
From now on, you and I

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.200
have nothing to do with each other.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.300
The position Kim Hye In held,

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.366
I'll claim it.

00:33:36.233 --> 00:33:38.333
That's what's most important to me right now.

00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:40.633
To me, you're...

00:33:40.633 --> 00:33:42.733
no use anymore.

00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:45.233
Got it.

00:33:45.233 --> 00:33:46.333
I get it for now, so first...

00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:48.266
Ah, come on!

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:52.033
Seo Do Un,

00:33:52.033 --> 00:33:53.533
are you stupid?

00:33:53.533 --> 00:33:58.066
The old Kim Hae In was fake.
The current one is real.

00:33:58.066 --> 00:34:00.366
You think the Diamond 6 is no big deal?

00:34:00.366 --> 00:34:03.433
You wouldn't know since you were in it.

00:34:03.433 --> 00:34:06.366
You'll never understand until you die.

00:34:06.366 --> 00:34:09.766
Honestly, I liked you
because you were a bit naive.

00:34:09.766 --> 00:34:12.500
Now, it's getting a little boring.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.166
So, can you stop clinging to me

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.300
and get lost?

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.300
Here.

00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:41.633
Look.

00:34:43.833 --> 00:34:45.900
Woo Jin!

00:34:50.133 --> 00:34:52.066
Thank you.

00:34:52.066 --> 00:34:53.900
Do you like it?

00:34:54.733 --> 00:34:58.566
You're coming to the club this weekend, right?

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.466
Of course, I'm going.

00:35:04.466 --> 00:35:06.533
You, really...

00:35:30.533 --> 00:35:32.533
But you

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:34.366
are unexpected.

00:35:39.666 --> 00:35:40.933
What are you talking about?

00:35:40.933 --> 00:35:44.166
Letting Park Woo Jin act like that...

00:35:48.466 --> 00:35:50.333
Don't tell me

00:35:51.433 --> 00:35:54.433
you're the only one who doesn't know

00:35:54.433 --> 00:35:56.933
how pretty and charming you are.

00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:27.466
Will you

00:36:29.433 --> 00:36:31.800
go somewhere with me?
